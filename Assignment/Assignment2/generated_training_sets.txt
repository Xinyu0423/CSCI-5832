<s> this is the genealogy of jesus the messiah the son of david  the son of abraham </s>
<s> thus there were fourteen generations in all from abraham to david  fourteen from david to the exile to babylon  and fourteen from the exile to the messiah </s>
<s> this is how the birth of jesus the messiah came about  his mother mary was pledged to be married to joseph  but before they came together  she was found to be pregnant through the holy spirit </s>
<s> because joseph her husband was faithful to the law  and yet did not want to expose her to public disgrace  he had in mind to divorce her quietly </s>
<s> but after he had considered this  an angel of the lord appeared to him in a dream and said   joseph son of david  do not be afraid to take mary home as your wife  because what is conceived in her is from the holy spirit </s>
<s> she will give birth to a son  and you are to give him the name jesus  because he will save his people from their sins  </s>
<s> all this took place to fulfil what the lord had said through the prophet </s>
<s>  the virgin will conceive and give birth to a son  and they will call him immanuel  which means  god with us  </s>
<s> when joseph woke up  he did what the angel of the lord had commanded him and took mary home as his wife </s>
<s> but he did not consummate their marriage until she gave birth to a son  and he gave him the name jesus </s>
<s> after jesus was born in bethlehem in judea  during the time of king herod  magi from the east came to jerusalem</s>
<s> and asked   where is the one who has been born king of the jews  we saw his star when it rose and have come to worship him  </s>
<s> when king herod heard this he was disturbed  and all jerusalem with him </s>
<s> when he had called together all the peoples chief priests and teachers of the law  he asked them where the messiah was to be born </s>
<s>  in bethlehem in judea   they replied   for this is what the prophet has written </s>
<s>   but you  bethlehem  in the land of judah  are by no means least among the rulers of judah  for out of you will come a ruler who will shepherd my people israel   </s>
<s> then herod called the magi secretly and found out from them the exact time the star had appeared </s>
<s> he sent them to bethlehem and said   go and search carefully for the child  as soon as you find him  report to me  so that i too may go and worship him  </s>
<s> after they had heard the king  they went on their way  and the star they had seen when it rose went ahead of them until it stopped over the place where the child was </s>
<s> when they saw the star  they were overjoyed </s>
<s> on coming to the house  they saw the child with his mother mary  and they bowed down and worshipped him  then they opened their treasures and presented him with gifts of gold  frankincense and myrrh </s>
<s> and having been warned in a dream not to go back to herod  they returned to their country by another route </s>
<s> when they had gone  an angel of the lord appeared to joseph in a dream   get up   he said   take the child and his mother and escape to egypt  stay there until i tell you  for herod is going to search for the child to kill him  </s>
<s> so he got up  took the child and his mother during the night and left for egypt </s>
<s> where he stayed until the death of herod  and so was fulfilled what the lord had said through the prophet   out of egypt i called my son  </s>
<s> when herod realised that he had been outwitted by the magi  he was furious  and he gave orders to kill all the boys in bethlehem and its vicinity who were two years old and under  in accordance with the time he had learned from the magi </s>
<s> then what was said through the prophet jeremiah was fulfilled </s>
<s>  a voice is heard in ramah  weeping and great mourning  rachel weeping for her children and refusing to be comforted  because they are no more  </s>
<s> after herod died  an angel of the lord appeared in a dream to joseph in egypt</s>
<s> and said   get up  take the child and his mother and go to the land of israel  for those who were trying to take the childs life are dead  </s>
<s> so he got up  took the child and his mother and went to the land of israel </s>
<s> but when he heard that archelaus was reigning in judea in place of his father herod  he was afraid to go there  having been warned in a dream  he withdrew to the district of galilee </s>
<s> and he went and lived in a town called nazareth  so was fulfilled what was said through the prophets  that he would be called a nazarene </s>
<s> in those days john the baptist came  preaching in the wilderness of judea</s>
<s> and saying   repent  for the kingdom of heaven has come near  </s>
<s> this is he who was spoken of through the prophet isaiah   a voice of one calling in the wilderness   prepare the way for the lord  make straight paths for him   </s>
<s> johns clothes were made of camels hair  and he had a leather belt round his waist  his food was locusts and wild honey </s>
<s> people went out to him from jerusalem and all judea and the whole region of the jordan </s>
<s> confessing their sins  they were baptised by him in the river jordan </s>
<s> but when he saw many of the pharisees and sadducees coming to where he was baptising  he said to them   you brood of vipers  who warned you to flee from the coming wrath </s>
<s> produce fruit in keeping with repentance </s>
<s> and do not think you can say to yourselves   we have abraham as our father   i tell you that out of these stones god can raise up children for abraham </s>
<s> the axe has been laid to the root of the trees  and every tree that does not produce good fruit will be cut down and thrown into the fire </s>
<s>  i baptise you with water for repentance  but after me comes one who is more powerful than i  whose sandals i am not worthy to carry  he will baptise you with the holy spirit and fire </s>
<s> his winnowing fork is in his hand  and he will clear his threshingfloor  gathering his wheat into the barn and burning up the chaff with unquenchable fire  </s>
<s> then jesus came from galilee to the jordan to be baptised by john </s>
<s> but john tried to deter him  saying   i need to be baptised by you  and do you come to me  </s>
<s> jesus replied   let it be so now  it is proper for us to do this to fulfil all righteousness   then john consented </s>
<s> as soon as jesus was baptised  he went up out of the water  at that moment heaven was opened  and he saw the spirit of god descending like a dove and alighting on him </s>
<s> and a voice from heaven said   this is my son  whom i love  with him i am well pleased  </s>
<s> then jesus was led by the spirit into the wilderness to be tempted by the devil </s>
<s> after fasting for forty days and forty nights  he was hungry </s>
<s> the tempter came to him and said   if you are the son of god  tell these stones to become bread  </s>
<s> jesus answered   it is written   man shall not live on bread alone  but on every word that comes from the mouth of god   </s>
<s> then the devil took him to the holy city and set him on the highest point of the temple </s>
<s>  if you are the son of god   he said   throw yourself down  for it is written   he will command his angels concerning you  and they will lift you up in their hands  so that you will not strike your foot against a stone   </s>
<s> jesus answered him   it is also written   do not put the lord your god to the test   </s>
<s> again  the devil took him to a very high mountain and showed him all the kingdoms of the world and their splendour </s>
<s>  all this i will give you   he said   if you will bow down and worship me  </s>
<s> jesus said to him   away from me  satan  for it is written   worship the lord your god  and serve him only   </s>
<s> then the devil left him  and angels came and attended him </s>
<s> when jesus heard that john had been put in prison  he withdrew to galilee </s>
<s> leaving nazareth  he went and lived in capernaum  which was by the lake in the area of zebulun and naphtali </s>
<s> to fulfil what was said through the prophet isaiah </s>
<s>  land of zebulun and land of naphtali  the way of the sea  beyond the jordan  galilee of the gentiles </s>
<s> the people living in darkness have seen a great light  on those living in the land of the shadow of death a light has dawned  </s>
<s> from that time on jesus began to preach   repent  for the kingdom of heaven has come near  </s>
<s> as jesus was walking beside the sea of galilee  he saw two brothers  simon called peter and his brother andrew  they were casting a net into the lake  for they were fishermen </s>
<s>  come  follow me   jesus said   and i will send you out to fish for people  </s>
<s> at once they left their nets and followed him </s>
<s> going on from there  he saw two other brothers  james son of zebedee and his brother john  they were in a boat with their father zebedee  preparing their nets  jesus called them </s>
<s> and immediately they left the boat and their father and followed him </s>
<s> jesus went throughout galilee  teaching in their synagogues  proclaiming the good news of the kingdom  and healing every disease and illness among the people </s>
<s> news about him spread all over syria  and people brought to him all who were ill with various diseases  those suffering severe pain  the demonpossessed  those having seizures  and the paralysed  and he healed them </s>
<s> large crowds from galilee  the decapolis  jerusalem  judea and the region across the jordan followed him </s>
<s> now when jesus saw the crowds  he went up on a mountainside and sat down  his disciples came to him </s>
<s> and he began to teach them  he said </s>
<s>  blessed are the poor in spirit  for theirs is the kingdom of heaven </s>
<s> blessed are those who mourn  for they will be comforted </s>
<s> blessed are the meek  for they will inherit the earth </s>
<s> blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness  for they will be filled </s>
<s> blessed are the merciful  for they will be shown mercy </s>
<s> blessed are the pure in heart  for they will see god </s>
<s> blessed are the peacemakers  for they will be called children of god </s>
<s> blessed are those who are persecuted because of righteousness  for theirs is the kingdom of heaven </s>
<s>  blessed are you when people insult you  persecute you and falsely say all kinds of evil against you because of me </s>
<s> rejoice and be glad  because great is your reward in heaven  for in the same way they persecuted the prophets who were before you </s>
<s>  you are the salt of the earth  but if the salt loses its saltiness  how can it be made salty again  it is no longer good for anything  except to be thrown out and trampled underfoot </s>
<s>  you are the light of the world  a town built on a hill cannot be hidden </s>
<s> neither do people light a lamp and put it under a bowl  instead they put it on its stand  and it gives light to everyone in the house </s>
<s> in the same way  let your light shine before others  that they may see your good deeds and glorify your father in heaven </s>
<s>  do not think that i have come to abolish the law or the prophets  i have not come to abolish them but to fulfil them </s>
<s> for truly i tell you  until heaven and earth disappear  not the smallest letter  not the least stroke of a pen  will by any means disappear from the law until everything is accomplished </s>
<s> therefore anyone who sets aside one of the least of these commands and teaches others accordingly will be called least in the kingdom of heaven  but whoever practises and teaches these commands will be called great in the kingdom of heaven </s>
<s> for i tell you that unless your righteousness surpasses that of the pharisees and the teachers of the law  you will certainly not enter the kingdom of heaven </s>
<s>  you have heard that it was said to the people long ago   you shall not murder  and anyone who murders will be subject to judgment  </s>
<s> but i tell you that anyone who is angry with a brother or sister  will be subject to judgment  again  anyone who says to a brother or sister   raca   is answerable to the court  and anyone who says   you fool   will be in danger of the fire of hell </s>
<s>  therefore  if you are offering your gift at the altar and there remember that your brother or sister has something against you </s>
<s> leave your gift there in front of the altar  first go and be reconciled to them  then come and offer your gift </s>
<s>  settle matters quickly with your adversary who is taking you to court  do it while you are still together on the way  or your adversary may hand you over to the judge  and the judge may hand you over to the officer  and you may be thrown into prison </s>
<s> truly i tell you  you will not get out until you have paid the last penny </s>
<s>  you have heard that it was said   you shall not commit adultery  </s>
<s> but i tell you that anyone who looks at a woman lustfully has already committed adultery with her in his heart </s>
<s> if your right eye causes you to stumble  gouge it out and throw it away  it is better for you to lose one part of your body than for your whole body to be thrown into hell </s>
<s> and if your right hand causes you to stumble  cut it off and throw it away  it is better for you to lose one part of your body than for your whole body to go into hell </s>
<s>  it has been said   anyone who divorces his wife must give her a certificate of divorce  </s>
<s> but i tell you that anyone who divorces his wife  except for sexual immorality  makes her the victim of adultery  and anyone who marries a divorced woman commits adultery </s>
<s>  again  you have heard that it was said to the people long ago   do not break your oath  but fulfil to the lord the oaths you have made  </s>
<s> but i tell you  do not swear an oath at all  either by heaven  for it is gods throne </s>
<s> or by the earth  for it is his footstool  or by jerusalem  for it is the city of the great king </s>
<s> and do not swear by your head  for you cannot make even one hair white or black </s>
<s> all you need to say is simply  yes   or  no   anything beyond this comes from the evil one </s>
<s>  you have heard that it was said   eye for eye  and tooth for tooth  </s>
<s> but i tell you  do not resist an evil person  if anyone slaps you on the right cheek  turn to them the other cheek also </s>
<s> and if anyone wants to sue you and take your shirt  hand over your coat as well </s>
<s> if anyone forces you to go one mile  go with them two miles </s>
<s> give to the one who asks you  and do not turn away from the one who wants to borrow from you </s>
<s>  you have heard that it was said   love your neighbour and hate your enemy  </s>
<s> but i tell you  love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you </s>
<s> that you may be children of your father in heaven  he causes his sun to rise on the evil and the good  and sends rain on the righteous and the unrighteous </s>
<s> if you love those who love you  what reward will you get  are not even the tax collectors doing that </s>

<s> be perfect  therefore  as your heavenly father is perfect </s>
<s>  be careful not to practise your righteousness in front of others to be seen by them  if you do  you will have no reward from your father in heaven </s>
<s>  so when you give to the needy  do not announce it with trumpets  as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and on the streets  to be honoured by others  truly i tell you  they have received their reward in full </s>
<s> but when you give to the needy  do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing </s>
<s> so that your giving may be in secret  then your father  who sees what is done in secret  will reward you </s>
<s>  and when you pray  do not be like the hypocrites  for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and on the street corners to be seen by others  truly i tell you  they have received their reward in full </s>
<s> but when you pray  go into your room  close the door and pray to your father  who is unseen  then your father  who sees what is done in secret  will reward you </s>
<s> and when you pray  do not keep on babbling like pagans  for they think they will be heard because of their many words </s>
<s> do not be like them  for your father knows what you need before you ask him </s>
<s>  this  then  is how you should pray    our father in heaven  hallowed be your name </s>
<s> your kingdom come  your will be done  on earth as it is in heaven </s>
<s> give us today our daily bread </s>
<s> and forgive us our debts  as we also have forgiven our debtors </s>
<s> and lead us not into temptation  but deliver us from the evil one  </s>
<s>  when you fast  do not look sombre as the hypocrites do  for they disfigure their faces to show others they are fasting  truly i tell you  they have received their reward in full </s>
<s> but when you fast  put oil on your head and wash your face </s>
<s> so that it will not be obvious to others that you are fasting  but only to your father  who is unseen  and your father  who sees what is done in secret  will reward you </s>
<s>  do not store up for yourselves treasures on earth  where moths and vermin destroy  and where thieves break in and steal </s>
<s> but store up for yourselves treasures in heaven  where moths and vermin do not destroy  and where thieves do not break in and steal </s>
<s> for where your treasure is  there your heart will be also </s>
<s>  the eye is the lamp of the body  if your eyes are healthy  your whole body will be full of light </s>

<s>  no one can serve two masters  either you will hate the one and love the other  or you will be devoted to the one and despise the other  you cannot serve both god and money </s>
<s>  therefore i tell you  do not worry about your life  what you will eat or drink  or about your body  what you will wear  is not life more than food  and the body more than clothes </s>
<s> look at the birds of the air  they do not sow or reap or store away in barns  and yet your heavenly father feeds them  are you not much more valuable than they </s>
<s> can any one of you by worrying add a single hour to your life </s>
<s>  and why do you worry about clothes  see how the flowers of the field grow  they do not labour or spin </s>
<s> yet i tell you that not even solomon in all his splendour was dressed like one of these </s>
<s> if that is how god clothes the grass of the field  which is here today and tomorrow is thrown into the fire  will he not much more clothe you  you of little faith </s>
<s> so do not worry  saying   what shall we eat   or  what shall we drink   or  what shall we wear  </s>
<s> for the pagans run after all these things  and your heavenly father knows that you need them </s>
<s> but seek first his kingdom and his righteousness  and all these things will be given to you as well </s>
<s> therefore do not worry about tomorrow  for tomorrow will worry about itself  each day has enough trouble of its own </s>
<s>  do not judge  or you too will be judged </s>
<s> for in the same way as you judge others  you will be judged  and with the measure you use  it will be measured to you </s>
<s>  why do you look at the speck of sawdust in your brothers eye and pay no attention to the plank in your own eye </s>
<s> how can you say to your brother   let me take the speck out of your eye   when all the time there is a plank in your own eye </s>
<s> you hypocrite  first take the plank out of your own eye  and then you will see clearly to remove the speck from your brothers eye </s>
<s>  do not give dogs what is sacred  do not throw your pearls to pigs  if you do  they may trample them under their feet  and turn and tear you to pieces </s>
<s>  ask and it will be given to you  seek and you will find  knock and the door will be opened to you </s>
<s> for everyone who asks receives  the one who seeks finds  and to the one who knocks  the door will be opened </s>
<s>  which of you  if your son asks for bread  will give him a stone </s>
<s> or if he asks for a fish  will give him a snake </s>
<s> if you  then  though you are evil  know how to give good gifts to your children  how much more will your father in heaven give good gifts to those who ask him </s>
<s> so in everything  do to others what you would have them do to you  for this sums up the law and the prophets </s>
<s>  enter through the narrow gate  for wide is the gate and broad is the road that leads to destruction  and many enter through it </s>
<s> but small is the gate and narrow the road that leads to life  and only a few find it </s>
<s>  watch out for false prophets  they come to you in sheeps clothing  but inwardly they are ferocious wolves </s>
<s> by their fruit you will recognise them  do people pick grapes from thornbushes  or figs from thistles </s>
<s> likewise  every good tree bears good fruit  but a bad tree bears bad fruit </s>
<s> a good tree cannot bear bad fruit  and a bad tree cannot bear good fruit </s>
<s> every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire </s>
<s> thus  by their fruit you will recognise them </s>
<s>  not everyone who says to me   lord  lord   will enter the kingdom of heaven  but only the one who does the will of my father who is in heaven </s>
<s> many will say to me on that day   lord  lord  did we not prophesy in your name and in your name drive out demons and in your name perform many miracles  </s>
<s> then i will tell them plainly   i never knew you  away from me  you evildoers  </s>
<s>  therefore everyone who hears these words of mine and puts them into practice is like a wise man who built his house on the rock </s>
<s> the rain came down  the streams rose  and the winds blew and beat against that house  yet it did not fall  because it had its foundation on the rock </s>
<s> but everyone who hears these words of mine and does not put them into practice is like a foolish man who built his house on sand </s>
<s> the rain came down  the streams rose  and the winds blew and beat against that house  and it fell with a great crash  </s>
<s> when jesus had finished saying these things  the crowds were amazed at his teaching </s>
<s> because he taught as one who had authority  and not as their teachers of the law </s>
<s> when jesus came down from the mountainside  large crowds followed him </s>
<s> a man with leprosy came and knelt before him and said   lord  if you are willing  you can make me clean  </s>
<s> jesus reached out his hand and touched the man   i am willing   he said   be clean   immediately he was cleansed of his leprosy </s>
<s> then jesus said to him   see that you dont tell anyone  but go  show yourself to the priest and offer the gift moses commanded  as a testimony to them  </s>
<s> when jesus had entered capernaum  a centurion came to him  asking for help </s>
<s>  lord   he said   my servant lies at home paralysed  suffering terribly  </s>
<s> jesus said to him   shall i come and heal him  </s>
<s> the centurion replied   lord  i do not deserve to have you come under my roof  but just say the word  and my servant will be healed </s>
<s> for i myself am a man under authority  with soldiers under me  i tell this one   go   and he goes  and that one   come   and he comes  i say to my servant   do this   and he does it  </s>
<s> when jesus heard this  he was amazed and said to those following him   truly i tell you  i have not found anyone in israel with such great faith </s>
<s> i say to you that many will come from the east and the west  and will take their places at the feast with abraham  isaac and jacob in the kingdom of heaven </s>
<s> but the subjects of the kingdom will be thrown outside  into the darkness  where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth  </s>
<s> then jesus said to the centurion   go  let it be done just as you believed it would   and his servant was healed at that moment </s>
<s> when jesus came into peters house  he saw peters motherinlaw lying in bed with a fever </s>
<s> he touched her hand and the fever left her  and she got up and began to wait on him </s>
<s> when evening came  many who were demonpossessed were brought to him  and he drove out the spirits with a word and healed all who were ill </s>
<s> this was to fulfil what was spoken through the prophet isaiah   he took up our infirmities and bore our diseases  </s>
<s> when jesus saw the crowd around him  he gave orders to cross to the other side of the lake </s>
<s> then a teacher of the law came to him and said   teacher  i will follow you wherever you go  </s>
<s> jesus replied   foxes have dens and birds have nests  but the son of man has nowhere to lay his head  </s>
<s> another disciple said to him   lord  first let me go and bury my father  </s>
<s> but jesus told him   follow me  and let the dead bury their own dead  </s>

<s> he replied   you of little faith  why are you so afraid   then he got up and rebuked the winds and the waves  and it was completely calm </s>
<s> the men were amazed and asked   what kind of man is this  even the winds and the waves obey him  </s>
<s> when he arrived at the other side in the region of the gadarenes  two demonpossessed men coming from the tombs met him  they were so violent that no one could pass that way </s>
<s>  what do you want with us  son of god   they shouted   have you come here to torture us before the appointed time  </s>
<s> some distance from them a large herd of pigs was feeding </s>
<s> the demons begged jesus   if you drive us out  send us into the herd of pigs  </s>
<s> he said to them   go   so they came out and went into the pigs  and the whole herd rushed down the steep bank into the lake and died in the water </s>
<s> those tending the pigs ran off  went into the town and reported all this  including what had happened to the demonpossessed men </s>
<s> then the whole town went out to meet jesus  and when they saw him  they pleaded with him to leave their region </s>
<s> jesus stepped into a boat  crossed over and came to his own town </s>
<s> some men brought to him a paralysed man  lying on a mat  when jesus saw their faith  he said to the man   take heart  son  your sins are forgiven  </s>
<s> at this  some of the teachers of the law said to themselves   this fellow is blaspheming  </s>
<s> knowing their thoughts  jesus said   why do you entertain evil thoughts in your hearts </s>
<s> which is easier  to say   your sins are forgiven   or to say   get up and walk  </s>
<s> but i want you to know that the son of man has authority on earth to forgive sins   so he said to the paralysed man   get up  take your mat and go home  </s>
<s> then the man got up and went home </s>
<s> when the crowd saw this  they were filled with awe  and they praised god  who had given such authority to man </s>

<s> but go and learn what this means   i desire mercy  not sacrifice   for i have not come to call the righteous  but sinners  </s>
<s> then johns disciples came and asked him   how is it that we and the pharisees fast often  but your disciples do not fast  </s>

<s> then he said to the man   stretch out your hand   so he stretched it out and it was completely restored  just as sound as the other </s>
<s> but the pharisees went out and plotted how they might kill jesus </s>

<s> then they brought him a demon possessed man who was blind and mute  and jesus healed him  so that he could both talk and see </s>
<s> all the people were astonished and said   could this be the son of david  </s>
<s> but when the pharisees heard this  they said   it is only by beelzebul  the prince of demons  that this fellow drives out demons  </s>
<s> jesus knew their thoughts and said to them   every kingdom divided against itself will be ruined  and every city or household divided against itself will not stand </s>

<s> and if i drive out demons by beelzebul  by whom do your people drive them out  so then  they will be your judges </s>

<s>  whoever is not with me is against me  and whoever does not gather with me scatters </s>

<s> for by your words you will be acquitted  and by your words you will be condemned  </s>
<s> then some of the pharisees and teachers of the law said to him   teacher  we want to see a sign from you  </s>
<s> he answered   a wicked and adulterous generation asks for a sign  but none will be given it except the sign of the prophet jonah </s>
<s> for as jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of a huge fish  so the son of man will be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth </s>

<s> while jesus was still talking to the crowd  his mother and brothers stood outside  wanting to speak to him </s>

<s> for whoever does the will of my father in heaven is my brother and sister and mother  </s>
<s> that same day jesus went out of the house and sat by the lake </s>
<s> such large crowds gathered round him that he got into a boat and sat in it  while all the people stood on the shore </s>
<s> then he told them many things in parables  saying   a farmer went out to sow his seed </s>
<s> as he was scattering the seed  some fell along the path  and the birds came and ate it up </s>
<s> some fell on rocky places  where it did not have much soil  it sprang up quickly  because the soil was shallow </s>
<s> but when the sun came up  the plants were scorched  and they withered because they had no root </s>
<s> other seed fell among thorns  which grew up and choked the plants </s>
<s> still other seed fell on good soil  where it produced a crop  a hundred  sixty or thirty times what was sown </s>
<s> whoever has ears  let them hear  </s>
<s> the disciples came to him and asked   why do you speak to the people in parables  </s>
<s> he replied   because the knowledge of the secrets of the kingdom of heaven has been given to you  but not to them </s>
<s> whoever has will be given more  and they will have an abundance  whoever does not have  even what they have will be taken from them </s>
<s> this is why i speak to them in parables   though seeing  they do not see  though hearing  they do not hear or understand    you will be ever hearing but never understanding  you will be ever seeing but never perceiving </s>
<s> for this peoples heart has become calloused  they hardly hear with their ears  and they have closed their eyes  otherwise they might see with their eyes  hear with their ears  understand with their hearts and turn  and i would heal them  </s>
<s>  listen then to what the parable of the sower means </s>
<s> when anyone hears the message about the kingdom and does not understand it  the evil one comes and snatches away what was sown in their heart  this is the seed sown along the path </s>
<s> the seed falling on rocky ground refers to someone who hears the word and at once receives it with joy </s>
<s> but since they have no root  they last only a short time  when trouble or persecution comes because of the word  they quickly fall away </s>
<s> the seed falling among the thorns refers to someone who hears the word  but the worries of this life and the deceitfulness of wealth choke the word  making it unfruitful </s>
<s> but the seed falling on good soil refers to someone who hears the word and understands it  this is the one who produces a crop  yielding a hundred  sixty or thirty times what was sown  </s>
<s> jesus told them another parable   the kingdom of heaven is like a man who sowed good seed in his field </s>
<s> but while everyone was sleeping  his enemy came and sowed weeds among the wheat  and went away </s>
<s> when the wheat sprouted and formed ears  then the weeds also appeared </s>
<s>  the owners servants came to him and said   sir  didnt you sow good seed in your field  where then did the weeds come from  </s>
<s>   an enemy did this   he replied   the servants asked him   do you want us to go and pull them up  </s>
<s>   no   he answered   because while you are pulling up the weeds  you may uproot the wheat with them </s>
<s> let both grow together until the harvest  at that time i will tell the harvesters  first collect the weeds and tie them in bundles to be burned  then gather the wheat and bring it into my barn   </s>
<s> he told them another parable   the kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed  which a man took and planted in his field </s>
<s> though it is the smallest of all seeds  yet when it grows  it is the largest of garden plants and becomes a tree  so that the birds come and perch in its branches  </s>
<s> he told them still another parable   the kingdom of heaven is like yeast that a woman took and mixed into about thirty kilograms of flour until it worked all through the dough  </s>
<s> jesus spoke all these things to the crowd in parables  he did not say anything to them without using a parable </s>
<s> so was fulfilled what was spoken through the prophet   i will open my mouth in parables  i will utter things hidden since the creation of the world  </s>
<s> then he left the crowd and went into the house  his disciples came to him and said   explain to us the parable of the weeds in the field  </s>
<s> he answered   the one who sowed the good seed is the son of man </s>
<s> the field is the world  and the good seed stands for the people of the kingdom  the weeds are the people of the evil one </s>
<s> and the enemy who sows them is the devil  the harvest is the end of the age  and the harvesters are angels </s>
<s>  as the weeds are pulled up and burned in the fire  so it will be at the end of the age </s>
<s> the son of man will send out his angels  and they will weed out of his kingdom everything that causes sin and all who do evil </s>
<s> they will throw them into the blazing furnace  where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth </s>
<s> then the righteous will shine like the sun in the kingdom of their father  whoever has ears  let them hear </s>
<s>  the kingdom of heaven is like treasure hidden in a field  when a man found it  he hid it again  and then in his joy went and sold all he had and bought that field </s>
<s>  again  the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant looking for fine pearls </s>
<s> when he found one of great value  he went away and sold everything he had and bought it </s>
<s>  once again  the kingdom of heaven is like a net that was let down into the lake and caught all kinds of fish </s>
<s> when it was full  the fishermen pulled it up on the shore  then they sat down and collected the good fish in baskets  but threw the bad away </s>
<s> this is how it will be at the end of the age  the angels will come and separate the wicked from the righteous</s>
<s> and throw them into the blazing furnace  where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth </s>
<s>  have you understood all these things   jesus asked   yes   they replied </s>
<s> he said to them   therefore every teacher of the law who has become a disciple in the kingdom of heaven is like the owner of a house who brings out of his storeroom new treasures as well as old  </s>
<s> when jesus had finished these parables  he moved on from there </s>
<s> coming to his home town  he began teaching the people in their synagogue  and they were amazed   where did this man get this wisdom and these miraculous powers   they asked </s>
<s>  isnt this the carpenters son  isnt his mothers name mary  and arent his brothers james  joseph  simon and judas </s>
<s> arent all his sisters with us  where then did this man get all these things  </s>
<s> and they took offence at him  but jesus said to them   a prophet is not without honour except in his own town and in his own home  </s>
<s> and he did not do many miracles there because of their lack of faith </s>
<s> at that time herod the tetrarch heard the reports about jesus </s>
<s> and he said to his attendants   this is john the baptist  he has risen from the dead  that is why miraculous powers are at work in him  </s>
<s> now herod had arrested john and bound him and put him in prison because of herodias  his brother philips wife </s>
<s> for john had been saying to him   it is not lawful for you to have her  </s>
<s> herod wanted to kill john  but he was afraid of the people  because they considered john a prophet </s>
<s> on herods birthday the daughter of herodias danced for the guests and pleased herod so much</s>
<s> that he promised with an oath to give her whatever she asked </s>
<s> prompted by her mother  she said   give me here on a dish the head of john the baptist  </s>
<s> the king was distressed  but because of his oaths and his dinner guests  he ordered that her request be granted</s>
<s> and had john beheaded in the prison </s>
<s> his head was brought in on a dish and given to the girl  who carried it to her mother </s>
<s> johns disciples came and took his body and buried it  then they went and told jesus </s>
<s> when jesus heard what had happened  he withdrew by boat privately to a solitary place  hearing of this  the crowds followed him on foot from the towns </s>
<s> when jesus landed and saw a large crowd  he had compassion on them and healed those who were ill </s>
<s> as evening approached  the disciples came to him and said   this is a remote place  and its already getting late  send the crowds away  so that they can go to the villages and buy themselves some food  </s>
<s> jesus replied   they do not need to go away  you give them something to eat  </s>
<s>  we have here only five loaves of bread and two fish   they answered </s>
<s>  bring them here to me   he said </s>
<s> and he told the people to sit down on the grass  taking the five loaves and the two fish and looking up to heaven  he gave thanks and broke the loaves  then he gave them to the disciples  and the disciples gave them to the people </s>
<s> they all ate and were satisfied  and the disciples picked up twelve basketfuls of broken pieces that were left over </s>
<s> the number of those who ate was about five thousand men  besides women and children </s>
<s> immediately jesus made the disciples get into the boat and go on ahead of him to the other side  while he dismissed the crowd </s>
<s> after he had dismissed them  he went up on a mountainside by himself to pray  later that night  he was there alone </s>
<s> and the boat was already a considerable distance from land  buffeted by the waves because the wind was against it </s>
<s> shortly before dawn jesus went out to them  walking on the lake </s>
<s> when the disciples saw him walking on the lake  they were terrified   its a ghost   they said  and cried out in fear </s>
<s> but jesus immediately said to them   take courage  it is i  dont be afraid  </s>
<s>  lord  if its you   peter replied   tell me to come to you on the water  </s>
<s>  come   he said  then peter got down out of the boat  walked on the water and came towards jesus </s>
<s> but when he saw the wind  he was afraid and  beginning to sink  cried out   lord  save me  </s>
<s> immediately jesus reached out his hand and caught him   you of little faith   he said   why did you doubt  </s>
<s> and when they climbed into the boat  the wind died down </s>
<s> then those who were in the boat worshipped him  saying   truly you are the son of god  </s>
<s> when they had crossed over  they landed at gennesaret </s>
<s> and when the men of that place recognised jesus  they sent word to all the surrounding country  people brought all who were ill to him</s>
<s> and begged him to let those who were ill just touch the edge of his cloak  and all who touched it were healed </s>
<s> then some pharisees and teachers of the law came to jesus from jerusalem and asked </s>
<s>  why do your disciples break the tradition of the elders  they dont wash their hands before they eat  </s>
<s> jesus replied   and why do you break the command of god for the sake of your tradition </s>
<s> for god said   honour your father and mother  and  anyone who curses their father or mother is to be put to death  </s>
<s> but you say that if anyone declares that what might have been used to help their father or mother is  devoted to god  </s>
<s> they are not to  honour their father or mother  with it  thus you nullify the word of god for the sake of your tradition </s>
<s> you hypocrites  isaiah was right when he prophesied about you </s>
<s>   these people honour me with their lips  but their hearts are far from me </s>
<s> they worship me in vain  their teachings are merely human rules   </s>
<s> jesus called the crowd to him and said   listen and understand </s>
<s> what goes into someones mouth does not defile them  but what comes out of their mouth  that is what defiles them  </s>
<s> then the disciples came to him and asked   do you know that the pharisees were offended when they heard this  </s>
<s> he replied   every plant that my heavenly father has not planted will be pulled up by the roots </s>
<s> leave them  they are blind guides  if the blind lead the blind  both will fall into a pit  </s>
<s> peter said   explain the parable to us  </s>
<s>  are you still so dull   jesus asked them </s>
<s>  dont you see that whatever enters the mouth goes into the stomach and then out of the body </s>
<s> but the things that come out of a persons mouth come from the heart  and these defile them </s>
<s> for out of the heart come evil thoughts  murder  adultery  sexual immorality  theft  false testimony  slander </s>
<s> these are what defile a person  but eating with unwashed hands does not defile them  </s>
<s> leaving that place  jesus withdrew to the region of tyre and sidon </s>
<s> a canaanite woman from that vicinity came to him  crying out   lord  son of david  have mercy on me  my daughter is demonpossessed and suffering terribly  </s>
<s> jesus did not answer a word  so his disciples came to him and urged him   send her away  for she keeps crying out after us  </s>
<s> he answered   i was sent only to the lost sheep of israel  </s>
<s> the woman came and knelt before him   lord  help me   she said </s>
<s> he replied   it is not right to take the childrens bread and toss it to the dogs  </s>
<s>  yes it is  lord   she said   even the dogs eat the crumbs that fall from their masters table  </s>
<s> then jesus said to her   woman  you have great faith  your request is granted   and her daughter was healed at that moment </s>
<s> jesus left there and went along the sea of galilee  then he went up on a mountainside and sat down </s>
<s> great crowds came to him  bringing the lame  the blind  the crippled  the mute and many others  and laid them at his feet  and he healed them </s>
<s> the people were amazed when they saw the mute speaking  the crippled made well  the lame walking and the blind seeing  and they praised the god of israel </s>
<s> jesus called his disciples to him and said   i have compassion for these people  they have already been with me three days and have nothing to eat  i do not want to send them away hungry  or they may collapse on the way  </s>
<s> his disciples answered   where could we get enough bread in this remote place to feed such a crowd  </s>
<s>  how many loaves do you have   jesus asked   seven   they replied   and a few small fish  </s>
<s> he told the crowd to sit down on the ground </s>
<s> then he took the seven loaves and the fish  and when he had given thanks  he broke them and gave them to the disciples  and they in turn to the people </s>
<s> they all ate and were satisfied  afterwards the disciples picked up seven basketfuls of broken pieces that were left over </s>
<s> the number of those who ate was four thousand men  besides women and children </s>
<s> after jesus had sent the crowd away  he got into the boat and went to the vicinity of magadan </s>
<s> the pharisees and sadducees came to jesus and tested him by asking him to show them a sign from heaven </s>
<s> he replied   when evening comes  you say   it will be fair weather  for the sky is red  </s>
<s> and in the morning   today it will be stormy  for the sky is red and overcast   you know how to interpret the appearance of the sky  but you cannot interpret the signs of the times </s>
<s> a wicked and adulterous generation looks for a sign  but none will be given it except the sign of jonah   jesus then left them and went away </s>
<s> when they went across the lake  the disciples forgot to take bread </s>
<s>  be careful   jesus said to them   be on your guard against the yeast of the pharisees and sadducees  </s>
<s> they discussed this among themselves and said   it is because we didnt bring any bread  </s>
<s> aware of their discussion  jesus asked   you of little faith  why are you talking among yourselves about having no bread </s>

<s> or the seven loaves for the four thousand  and how many basketfuls you gathered </s>
<s> how is it you dont understand that i was not talking to you about bread  but be on your guard against the yeast of the pharisees and sadducees  </s>
<s> then they understood that he was not telling them to guard against the yeast used in bread  but against the teaching of the pharisees and sadducees </s>
<s> when jesus came to the region of caesarea philippi  he asked his disciples   who do people say the son of man is  </s>
<s> they replied   some say john the baptist  others say elijah  and still others  jeremiah or one of the prophets  </s>
<s>  but what about you   he asked   who do you say i am  </s>
<s> simon peter answered   you are the messiah  the son of the living god  </s>
<s> jesus replied   blessed are you  simon son of jonah  for this was not revealed to you by flesh and blood  but by my father in heaven </s>
<s> and i tell you that you are peter  and on this rock i will build my church  and the gates of hades will not overcome it </s>
<s> i will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven  whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven  and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven  </s>
<s> then he ordered his disciples not to tell anyone that he was the messiah </s>
<s> from that time on jesus began to explain to his disciples that he must go to jerusalem and suffer many things at the hands of the elders  the chief priests and the teachers of the law  and that he must be killed and on the third day be raised to life </s>
<s> peter took him aside and began to rebuke him   never  lord   he said   this shall never happen to you  </s>
<s> jesus turned and said to peter   get behind me  satan  you are a stumblingblock to me  you do not have in mind the concerns of god  but merely human concerns  </s>
<s> then jesus said to his disciples   whoever wants to be my disciple must deny themselves and take up their cross and follow me </s>
<s> for whoever wants to save their life will lose it  but whoever loses their life for me will find it </s>
<s> what good will it be for someone to gain the whole world  yet forfeit their soul  or what can anyone give in exchange for their soul </s>
<s> for the son of man is going to come in his fathers glory with his angels  and then he will reward each person according to what they have done </s>
<s>  truly i tell you  some who are standing here will not taste death before they see the son of man coming in his kingdom  </s>
<s> after six days jesus took with him peter  james and john the brother of james  and led them up a high mountain by themselves </s>

<s> jesus replied   to be sure  elijah comes and will restore all things </s>
<s> but i tell you  elijah has already come  and they did not recognise him  but have done to him everything they wished  in the same way the son of man is going to suffer at their hands  </s>
<s> then the disciples understood that he was talking to them about john the baptist </s>

<s> jesus rebuked the demon  and it came out of the boy  and he was healed at that moment </s>
<s> then the disciples came to jesus in private and asked   why couldnt we drive it out  </s>
<s> he replied   because you have so little faith  truly i tell you  if you have faith as small as a mustard seed  you can say to this mountain   move from here to there   and it will move  nothing will be impossible for you   </s>
<s> </s>
<s> when they came together in galilee  he said to them   the son of man is going to be delivered into the hands of men </s>
<s> they will kill him  and on the third day he will be raised to life   and the disciples were filled with grief </s>
<s> after jesus and his disciples arrived in capernaum  the collectors of the twodrachma temple tax came to peter and asked   doesnt your teacher pay the temple tax  </s>
<s>  yes  he does   he replied  when peter came into the house  jesus was the first to speak   what do you think  simon   he asked   from whom do the kings of the earth collect duty and taxes  from their own children or from others  </s>
<s>  from others   peter answered   then the children are exempt   jesus said to him </s>
<s>  but so that we may not cause offence  go to the lake and throw out your line  take the first fish you catch  open its mouth and you will find a fourdrachma coin  take it and give it to them for my tax and yours  </s>
<s> at that time the disciples came to jesus and asked   who  then  is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven  </s>
<s> he called a little child to him  and placed the child among them </s>
<s> and he said   truly i tell you  unless you change and become like little children  you will never enter the kingdom of heaven </s>
<s> therefore  whoever takes the lowly position of this child is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven </s>
<s> and whoever welcomes one such child in my name welcomes me </s>
<s>  if anyone causes one of these little ones  those who believe in me  to stumble  it would be better for them to have a large millstone hung round their neck and to be drowned in the depths of the sea </s>
<s> woe to the world because of the things that cause people to stumble  such things must come  but woe to the person through whom they come </s>
<s> if your hand or your foot causes you to stumble  cut it off and throw it away  it is better for you to enter life maimed or crippled than to have two hands or two feet and be thrown into eternal fire </s>
<s> and if your eye causes you to stumble  gouge it out and throw it away  it is better for you to enter life with one eye than to have two eyes and be thrown into the fire of hell </s>
<s>  see that you do not despise one of these little ones  for i tell you that their angels in heaven always see the face of my father in heaven  </s>
<s> </s>
<s>  what do you think  if a man owns a hundred sheep  and one of them wanders away  will he not leave the ninetynine on the hills and go to look for the one that wandered off </s>
<s> and if he finds it  truly i tell you  he is happier about that one sheep than about the ninetynine that did not wander off </s>
<s> in the same way your father in heaven is not willing that any of these little ones should perish </s>
<s>  if your brother or sister sins  go and point out their fault  just between the two of you  if they listen to you  you have won them over </s>
<s> but if they will not listen  take one or two others along  so that  every matter may be established by the testimony of two or three witnesses  </s>
<s> if they still refuse to listen  tell it to the church  and if they refuse to listen even to the church  treat them as you would a pagan or a tax collector </s>
<s>  truly i tell you  whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven  and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven </s>
<s>  again  truly i tell you that if two of you on earth agree about anything they ask for  it will be done for them by my father in heaven </s>
<s> for where two or three gather in my name  there am i with them  </s>
<s> then peter came to jesus and asked   lord  how many times shall i forgive my brother or sister who sins against me  up to seven times  </s>
<s> jesus answered   i tell you  not seven times  but seventyseven times </s>
<s>  therefore  the kingdom of heaven is like a king who wanted to settle accounts with his servants </s>
<s> as he began the settlement  a man who owed him ten thousand bags of gold was brought to him </s>
<s> since he was not able to pay  the master ordered that he and his wife and his children and all that he had be sold to repay the debt </s>
<s>  at this the servant fell on his knees before him   be patient with me   he begged   and i will pay back everything  </s>
<s> the servants master took pity on him  cancelled the debt and let him go </s>
<s>  but when that servant went out  he found one of his fellow servants who owed him a hundred silver coins  he grabbed him and began to choke him   pay back what you owe me   he demanded </s>
<s>  his fellow servant fell to his knees and begged him   be patient with me  and i will pay it back  </s>
<s>  but he refused  instead  he went off and had the man thrown into prison until he could pay the debt </s>
<s> when the other servants saw what had happened  they were outraged and went and told their master everything that had happened </s>
<s>  then the master called the servant in   you wicked servant   he said   i cancelled all that debt of yours because you begged me to </s>
<s> shouldnt you have had mercy on your fellow servant just as i had on you  </s>
<s> in anger his master handed him over to the jailers to be tortured  until he should pay back all he owed </s>
<s>  this is how my heavenly father will treat each of you unless you forgive your brother or sister from your heart  </s>
<s> when jesus had finished saying these things  he left galilee and went into the region of judea to the other side of the jordan </s>
<s> large crowds followed him  and he healed them there </s>
<s> some pharisees came to him to test him  they asked   is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any and every reason  </s>
<s>  havent you read   he replied   that at the beginning the creator  made them male and female  </s>
<s> and said   for this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife  and the two will become one flesh  </s>
<s> so they are no longer two  but one flesh  therefore what god has joined together  let no one separate  </s>
<s>  why then   they asked   did moses command that a man give his wife a certificate of divorce and send her away  </s>
<s> jesus replied   moses permitted you to divorce your wives because your hearts were hard  but it was not this way from the beginning </s>
<s> i tell you that anyone who divorces his wife  except for sexual immorality  and marries another woman commits adultery  </s>
<s> the disciples said to him   if this is the situation between a husband and wife  it is better not to marry  </s>
<s> jesus replied   not everyone can accept this word  but only those to whom it has been given </s>
<s> for there are eunuchs who were born that way  and there are eunuchs who have been made eunuchs by others  and there are those who choose to live like eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of heaven  the one who can accept this should accept it  </s>
<s> then people brought little children to jesus for him to place his hands on them and pray for them  but the disciples rebuked them </s>
<s> jesus said   let the little children come to me  and do not hinder them  for the kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these  </s>
<s> when he had placed his hands on them  he went on from there </s>
<s> just then a man came up to jesus and asked   teacher  what good thing must i do to get eternal life  </s>
<s>  why do you ask me about what is good   jesus replied   there is only one who is good  if you want to enter life  keep the commandments  </s>
<s>  which ones   he enquired  jesus replied    you shall not murder  you shall not commit adultery  you shall not steal  you shall not give false testimony </s>
<s> honour your father and mother   and  love your neighbour as yourself   </s>
<s>  all these i have kept   the young man said   what do i still lack  </s>
<s> jesus answered   if you want to be perfect  go  sell your possessions and give to the poor  and you will have treasure in heaven  then come  follow me  </s>
<s> when the young man heard this  he went away sad  because he had great wealth </s>
<s> then jesus said to his disciples   truly i tell you  it is hard for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of heaven </s>
<s> again i tell you  it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of god  </s>
<s> when the disciples heard this  they were greatly astonished and asked   who then can be saved  </s>
<s> jesus looked at them and said   with man this is impossible  but with god all things are possible  </s>
<s> peter answered him   we have left everything to follow you  what then will there be for us  </s>
<s> jesus said to them   truly i tell you  at the renewal of all things  when the son of man sits on his glorious throne  you who have followed me will also sit on twelve thrones  judging the twelve tribes of israel </s>
<s> and everyone who has left houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or wife or children or fields for my sake will receive a hundred times as much and will inherit eternal life </s>
<s> but many who are first will be last  and many who are last will be first </s>
<s>  for the kingdom of heaven is like a landowner who went out early in the morning to hire workers for his vineyard </s>
<s> he agreed to pay them a denarius for the day and sent them into his vineyard </s>
<s>  about nine in the morning he went out and saw others standing in the marketplace doing nothing </s>
<s> he told them   you also go and work in my vineyard  and i will pay you whatever is right  </s>
<s> so they went   he went out again about noon and about three in the afternoon and did the same thing </s>
<s> about five in the afternoon he went out and found still others standing around  he asked them   why have you been standing here all day long doing nothing  </s>
<s>   because no one has hired us   they answered   he said to them   you also go and work in my vineyard  </s>
<s>  when evening came  the owner of the vineyard said to his foreman   call the workers and pay them their wages  beginning with the last ones hired and going on to the first  </s>
<s>  the workers who were hired about five in the afternoon came and each received a denarius </s>
<s> so when those came who were hired first  they expected to receive more  but each one of them also received a denarius </s>
<s> when they received it  they began to grumble against the landowner </s>
<s>  these who were hired last worked only one hour   they said   and you have made them equal to us who have borne the burden of the work and the heat of the day  </s>
<s>  but he answered one of them   i am not being unfair to you  friend  didnt you agree to work for a denarius </s>
<s> take your pay and go  i want to give the one who was hired last the same as i gave you </s>
<s> dont i have the right to do what i want with my own money  or are you envious because i am generous  </s>
<s>  so the last will be first  and the first will be last  </s>
<s> now jesus was going up to jerusalem  on the way  he took the twelve aside and said to them </s>
<s>  we are going up to jerusalem  and the son of man will be delivered over to the chief priests and the teachers of the law  they will condemn him to death</s>
<s> and will hand him over to the gentiles to be mocked and flogged and crucified  on the third day he will be raised to life  </s>
<s> then the mother of zebedees sons came to jesus with her sons and  kneeling down  asked a favour of him </s>
<s>  what is it you want   he asked  she said   grant that one of these two sons of mine may sit at your right and the other at your left in your kingdom  </s>
<s>  you dont know what you are asking   jesus said to them   can you drink the cup i am going to drink    we can   they answered </s>
<s> jesus said to them   you will indeed drink from my cup  but to sit at my right or left is not for me to grant  these places belong to those for whom they have been prepared by my father  </s>
<s> when the ten heard about this  they were indignant with the two brothers </s>
<s> jesus called them together and said   you know that the rulers of the gentiles lord it over them  and their high officials exercise authority over them </s>
<s> not so with you  instead  whoever wants to become great among you must be your servant </s>
<s> and whoever wants to be first must be your slave </s>
<s> just as the son of man did not come to be served  but to serve  and to give his life as a ransom for many  </s>
<s> as jesus and his disciples were leaving jericho  a large crowd followed him </s>
<s> two blind men were sitting by the roadside  and when they heard that jesus was passing by  they shouted   lord  son of david  have mercy on us  </s>
<s> the crowd rebuked them and told them to be quiet  but they shouted all the louder   lord  son of david  have mercy on us  </s>
<s> jesus stopped and called them   what do you want me to do for you   he asked </s>
<s>  lord   they answered   we want our sight  </s>
<s> jesus had compassion on them and touched their eyes  immediately they received their sight and followed him </s>
<s> as they approached jerusalem and came to bethphage on the mount of olives  jesus sent two disciples </s>
<s> saying to them   go to the village ahead of you  and at once you will find a donkey tied there  with her colt by her  untie them and bring them to me </s>
<s> if anyone says anything to you  say that the lord needs them  and he will send them right away  </s>
<s> this took place to fulfil what was spoken through the prophet </s>
<s>  say to daughter zion   see  your king comes to you  gentle and riding on a donkey  and on a colt  the foal of a donkey   </s>
<s> the disciples went and did as jesus had instructed them </s>
<s> they brought the donkey and the colt and placed their cloaks on them for jesus to sit on </s>
<s> a very large crowd spread their cloaks on the road  while others cut branches from the trees and spread them on the road </s>
<s> the crowds that went ahead of him and those that followed shouted  stanza break  hosanna to the son of david    blessed is he who comes in the name of the lord    hosanna in the highest heaven  </s>
<s> when jesus entered jerusalem  the whole city was stirred and asked   who is this  </s>
<s> the crowds answered   this is jesus  the prophet from nazareth in galilee  </s>
<s> jesus entered the temple courts and drove out all who were buying and selling there  he overturned the tables of the moneychangers and the benches of those selling doves </s>
<s>  it is written   he said to them    my house will be called a house of prayer   but you are making it  a den of robbers   </s>
<s> the blind and the lame came to him at the temple  and he healed them </s>
<s> but when the chief priests and the teachers of the law saw the wonderful things he did and the children shouting in the temple courts   hosanna to the son of david   they were indignant </s>
<s>  do you hear what these children are saying   they asked him   yes   replied jesus   have you never read    from the lips of children and infants you  lord  have called forth your praise   </s>
<s> and he left them and went out of the city to bethany  where he spent the night </s>
<s> early in the morning  as jesus was on his way back to the city  he was hungry </s>
<s> seeing a figtree by the road  he went up to it but found nothing on it except leaves  then he said to it   may you never bear fruit again   immediately the tree withered </s>
<s> when the disciples saw this  they were amazed   how did the figtree wither so quickly   they asked </s>
<s> jesus replied   truly i tell you  if you have faith and do not doubt  not only can you do what was done to the figtree  but also you can say to this mountain   go  throw yourself into the sea   and it will be done </s>
<s> if you believe  you will receive whatever you ask for in prayer  </s>
<s> jesus entered the temple courts  and  while he was teaching  the chief priests and the elders of the people came to him   by what authority are you doing these things   they asked   and who gave you this authority  </s>
<s> jesus replied   i will also ask you one question  if you answer me  i will tell you by what authority i am doing these things </s>
<s> johns baptism  where did it come from  was it from heaven  or of human origin   they discussed it among themselves and said   if we say   from heaven   he will ask   then why didnt you believe him  </s>
<s> but if we say   of human origin   we are afraid of the people  for they all hold that john was a prophet  </s>
<s> so they answered jesus   we dont know   then he said   neither will i tell you by what authority i am doing these things </s>
<s>  what do you think  there was a man who had two sons  he went to the first and said   son  go and work today in the vineyard  </s>
<s>   i will not   he answered  but later he changed his mind and went </s>
<s>  then the father went to the other son and said the same thing  he answered   i will  sir   but he did not go </s>
<s>  which of the two did what his father wanted    the first   they answered  jesus said to them   truly i tell you  the tax collectors and the prostitutes are entering the kingdom of god ahead of you </s>
<s> for john came to you to show you the way of righteousness  and you did not believe him  but the tax collectors and the prostitutes did  and even after you saw this  you did not repent and believe him </s>
<s>  listen to another parable  there was a landowner who planted a vineyard  he put a wall round it  dug a winepress in it and built a watchtower  then he rented the vineyard to some farmers and moved to another place </s>
<s> when the harvest time approached  he sent his servants to the tenants to collect his fruit </s>
<s>  the tenants seized his servants  they beat one  killed another  and stoned a third </s>
<s> then he sent other servants to them  more than the first time  and the tenants treated them in the same way </s>
<s> last of all  he sent his son to them   they will respect my son   he said </s>
<s>  but when the tenants saw the son  they said to each other   this is the heir  come  lets kill him and take his inheritance  </s>
<s> so they took him and threw him out of the vineyard and killed him </s>
<s>  therefore  when the owner of the vineyard comes  what will he do to those tenants  </s>
<s>  he will bring those wretches to a wretched end   they replied   and he will rent the vineyard to other tenants  who will give him his share of the crop at harvest time  </s>
<s> jesus said to them   have you never read in the scriptures    the stone the builders rejected has become the cornerstone  the lord has done this  and it is marvellous in our eyes  </s>
<s>  therefore i tell you that the kingdom of god will be taken away from you and given to a people who will produce its fruit </s>
<s> anyone who falls on this stone will be broken to pieces  anyone on whom it falls will be crushed  </s>
<s> when the chief priests and the pharisees heard jesus parables  they knew he was talking about them </s>
<s> they looked for a way to arrest him  but they were afraid of the crowd because the people held that he was a prophet </s>
<s> jesus spoke to them again in parables  saying </s>
<s>  the kingdom of heaven is like a king who prepared a wedding banquet for his son </s>
<s> he sent his servants to those who had been invited to the banquet to tell them to come  but they refused to come </s>
<s>  then he sent some more servants and said   tell those who have been invited that i have prepared my dinner  my oxen and fattened cattle have been slaughtered  and everything is ready  come to the wedding banquet  </s>
<s>  but they paid no attention and went off  one to his field  another to his business </s>
<s> the rest seized his servants  illtreated them and killed them </s>
<s> the king was enraged  he sent his army and destroyed those murderers and burned their city </s>
<s>  then he said to his servants   the wedding banquet is ready  but those i invited did not deserve to come </s>
<s> so go to the street corners and invite to the banquet anyone you find  </s>
<s> so the servants went out into the streets and gathered all the people they could find  the bad as well as the good  and the wedding hall was filled with guests </s>
<s>  but when the king came in to see the guests  he noticed a man there who was not wearing wedding clothes </s>
<s> he asked   how did you get in here without wedding clothes  friend   the man was speechless </s>
<s>  then the king told the attendants   tie him hand and foot  and throw him outside  into the darkness  where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth  </s>
<s>  for many are invited  but few are chosen  </s>
<s> then the pharisees went out and laid plans to trap him in his words </s>
<s> they sent their disciples to him along with the herodians   teacher   they said   we know that you are a man of integrity and that you teach the way of god in accordance with the truth  you arent swayed by others  because you pay no attention to who they are </s>
<s> tell us then  what is your opinion  is it right to pay the polltax to caesar or not  </s>
<s> but jesus  knowing their evil intent  said   you hypocrites  why are you trying to trap me </s>
<s> show me the coin used for paying the tax   they brought him a denarius </s>
<s> and he asked them   whose image is this  and whose inscription  </s>
<s>  caesars   they replied  then he said to them   so give back to caesar what is caesars  and to god what is gods  </s>
<s> when they heard this  they were amazed  so they left him and went away </s>
<s> that same day the sadducees  who say there is no resurrection  came to him with a question </s>
<s>  teacher   they said   moses told us that if a man dies without having children  his brother must marry the widow and raise up offspring for him </s>
<s> now there were seven brothers among us  the first one married and died  and since he had no children  he left his wife to his brother </s>
<s> the same thing happened to the second and third brother  right on down to the seventh </s>
<s> finally  the woman died </s>
<s> now then  at the resurrection  whose wife will she be of the seven  since all of them were married to her  </s>
<s> jesus replied   you are in error because you do not know the scriptures or the power of god </s>
<s> at the resurrection people will neither marry nor be given in marriage  they will be like the angels in heaven </s>
<s> but about the resurrection of the dead  have you not read what god said to you </s>
<s>  i am the god of abraham  the god of isaac  and the god of jacob   he is not the god of the dead but of the living  </s>
<s> when the crowds heard this  they were astonished at his teaching </s>
<s> hearing that jesus had silenced the sadducees  the pharisees got together </s>
<s> one of them  an expert in the law  tested him with this question </s>
<s>  teacher  which is the greatest commandment in the law  </s>
<s> jesus replied    love the lord your god with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind  </s>
<s> this is the first and greatest commandment </s>
<s> and the second is like it   love your neighbour as yourself  </s>
<s> all the law and the prophets hang on these two commandments  </s>
<s> while the pharisees were gathered together  jesus asked them </s>
<s>  what do you think about the messiah  whose son is he    the son of david   they replied </s>
<s> he said to them   how is it then that david  speaking by the spirit  calls him  lord   for he says </s>
<s>   the lord said to my lord   sit at my right hand until i put your enemies under your feet   </s>
<s> then jesus said to the crowds and to his disciples </s>
<s>  the teachers of the law and the pharisees sit in moses seat </s>
<s> so you must be careful to do everything they tell you  but do not do what they do  for they do not practise what they preach </s>
<s> they tie up heavy  cumbersome loads and put them on other peoples shoulders  but they themselves are not willing to lift a finger to move them </s>
<s>  everything they do is done for people to see  they make their phylacteries wide and the tassels on their garments long </s>
<s> they love the place of honour at banquets and the most important seats in the synagogues </s>
<s> they love to be greeted with respect in the marketplaces and to be called  rabbi  by others </s>
<s>  but you are not to be called  rabbi   for you have one teacher  and you are all brothers </s>

<s> the greatest among you will be your servant </s>

<s> for many will come in my name  claiming   i am the messiah   and will deceive many </s>
<s> you will hear of wars and rumours of wars  but see to it that you are not alarmed  such things must happen  but the end is still to come </s>
<s> nation will rise against nation  and kingdom against kingdom  there will be famines and earthquakes in various places </s>
<s> all these are the beginning of birthpains </s>
<s>  then you will be handed over to be persecuted and put to death  and you will be hated by all nations because of me </s>
<s> at that time many will turn away from the faith and will betray and hate each other </s>
<s> and many false prophets will appear and deceive many people </s>
<s> because of the increase of wickedness  the love of most will grow cold </s>
<s> but the one who stands firm to the end will be saved </s>

<s>  so when you see standing in the holy place  the abomination that causes desolation   spoken of through the prophet daniel  let the reader understand </s>
<s> then let those who are in judea flee to the mountains </s>

<s> how dreadful it will be in those days for pregnant women and nursing mothers </s>

<s>  if those days had not been cut short  no one would survive  but for the sake of the elect those days will be shortened </s>

<s>  then will appear the sign of the son of man in heaven  and then all the peoples of the earth will mourn when they see the son of man coming on the clouds of heaven  with power and great glory </s>
<s> and he will send his angels with a loud trumpet call  and they will gather his elect from the four winds  from one end of the heavens to the other </s>
<s>  now learn this lesson from the figtree  as soon as its twigs become tender and its leaves come out  you know that summer is near </s>
<s> even so  when you see all these things  you know that it is near  right at the door </s>
<s> truly i tell you  this generation will certainly not pass away until all these things have happened </s>
<s> heaven and earth will pass away  but my words will never pass away </s>
<s>  but about that day or hour no one knows  not even the angels in heaven  nor the son  but only the father </s>
<s> as it was in the days of noah  so it will be at the coming of the son of man </s>
<s> for in the days before the flood  people were eating and drinking  marrying and giving in marriage  up to the day noah entered the ark </s>
<s> and they knew nothing about what would happen until the flood came and took them all away  that is how it will be at the coming of the son of man </s>
<s> two men will be in the field  one will be taken and the other left </s>
<s> two women will be grinding with a hand mill  one will be taken and the other left </s>
<s>  therefore keep watch  because you do not know on what day your lord will come </s>
<s> but understand this  if the owner of the house had known at what time of night the thief was coming  he would have kept watch and would not have let his house be broken into </s>
<s> so you also must be ready  because the son of man will come at an hour when you do not expect him </s>
<s>  who then is the faithful and wise servant  whom the master has put in charge of the servants in his household to give them their food at the proper time </s>
<s> it will be good for that servant whose master finds him doing so when he returns </s>
<s> truly i tell you  he will put him in charge of all his possessions </s>
<s> but suppose that servant is wicked and says to himself   my master is staying away a long time  </s>
<s> and he then begins to beat his fellow servants and to eat and drink with drunkards </s>
<s> the master of that servant will come on a day when he does not expect him and at an hour he is not aware of </s>
<s> he will cut him to pieces and assign him a place with the hypocrites  where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth </s>
<s>  at that time the kingdom of heaven will be like ten virgins who took their lamps and went out to meet the bridegroom </s>
<s> five of them were foolish and five were wise </s>
<s> the foolish ones took their lamps but did not take any oil with them </s>
<s> the wise ones  however  took oil in jars along with their lamps </s>
<s> the bridegroom was a long time in coming  and they all became drowsy and fell asleep </s>
<s>  at midnight the cry rang out   heres the bridegroom  come out to meet him  </s>
<s>  then all the virgins woke up and trimmed their lamps </s>
<s> the foolish ones said to the wise   give us some of your oil  our lamps are going out  </s>
<s>   no   they replied   there may not be enough for both us and you  instead  go to those who sell oil and buy some for yourselves  </s>
<s>  but while they were on their way to buy the oil  the bridegroom arrived  the virgins who were ready went in with him to the wedding banquet  and the door was shut </s>
<s>  later the others also came   lord  lord   they said   open the door for us  </s>
<s>  but he replied   truly i tell you  i dont know you  </s>
<s>  therefore keep watch  because you do not know the day or the hour </s>
<s>  again  it will be like a man going on a journey  who called his servants and entrusted his wealth to them </s>
<s> to one he gave five bags of gold  to another two bags  and to another one bag  each according to his ability  then he went on his journey </s>
<s> the man who had received five bags of gold went at once and put his money to work and gained five bags more </s>
<s> so also  the one with two bags of gold gained two more </s>
<s> but the man who had received one bag went off  dug a hole in the ground and hid his masters money </s>
<s>  after a long time the master of those servants returned and settled accounts with them </s>
<s> the man who had received five bags of gold brought the other five   master   he said   you entrusted me with five bags of gold  see  i have gained five more  </s>
<s>  his master replied   well done  good and faithful servant  you have been faithful with a few things  i will put you in charge of many things  come and share your masters happiness  </s>
<s>  the man with two bags of gold also came   master   he said   you entrusted me with two bags of gold  see  i have gained two more  </s>
<s>  his master replied   well done  good and faithful servant  you have been faithful with a few things  i will put you in charge of many things  come and share your masters happiness  </s>
<s>  then the man who had received one bag of gold came   master   he said   i knew that you are a hard man  harvesting where you have not sown and gathering where you have not scattered seed </s>
<s> so i was afraid and went out and hid your gold in the ground  see  here is what belongs to you  </s>
<s>  his master replied   you wicked  lazy servant  so you knew that i harvest where i have not sown and gather where i have not scattered seed </s>
<s> well then  you should have put my money on deposit with the bankers  so that when i returned i would have received it back with interest </s>
<s>   so take the bag of gold from him and give it to the one who has ten bags </s>
<s> for whoever has will be given more  and they will have an abundance  whoever does not have  even what they have will be taken from them </s>
<s> and throw that worthless servant outside  into the darkness  where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth  </s>
<s>  when the son of man comes in his glory  and all the angels with him  he will sit on his glorious throne </s>
<s> all the nations will be gathered before him  and he will separate the people one from another as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats </s>
<s> he will put the sheep on his right and the goats on his left </s>
<s>  then the king will say to those on his right   come  you who are blessed by my father  take your inheritance  the kingdom prepared for you since the creation of the world </s>
<s> for i was hungry and you gave me something to eat  i was thirsty and you gave me something to drink  i was a stranger and you invited me in </s>
<s> i needed clothes and you clothed me  i was ill and you looked after me  i was in prison and you came to visit me  </s>
<s>  then the righteous will answer him   lord  when did we see you hungry and feed you  or thirsty and give you something to drink </s>
<s> when did we see you a stranger and invite you in  or needing clothes and clothe you </s>
<s> when did we see you ill or in prison and go to visit you  </s>
<s>  the king will reply   truly i tell you  whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers and sisters of mine  you did for me  </s>
<s>  then he will say to those on his left   depart from me  you who are cursed  into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels </s>
<s> for i was hungry and you gave me nothing to eat  i was thirsty and you gave me nothing to drink </s>
<s> i was a stranger and you did not invite me in  i needed clothes and you did not clothe me  i was ill and in prison and you did not look after me  </s>
<s>  they also will answer   lord  when did we see you hungry or thirsty or a stranger or needing clothes or ill or in prison  and did not help you  </s>
<s>  he will reply   truly i tell you  whatever you did not do for one of the least of these  you did not do for me  </s>
<s>  then they will go away to eternal punishment  but the righteous to eternal life  </s>
<s> when jesus had finished saying all these things  he said to his disciples </s>
<s>  as you know  the passover is two days away  and the son of man will be handed over to be crucified  </s>
<s> then the chief priests and the elders of the people assembled in the palace of the high priest  whose name was caiaphas </s>
<s> and they schemed to arrest jesus secretly and kill him </s>
<s>  but not during the festival   they said   or there may be a riot among the people  </s>
<s> while jesus was in bethany in the home of simon the leper </s>
<s> a woman came to him with an alabaster jar of very expensive perfume  which she poured on his head as he was reclining at the table </s>
<s> when the disciples saw this  they were indignant   why this waste   they asked </s>
<s>  this perfume could have been sold at a high price and the money given to the poor  </s>
<s> aware of this  jesus said to them   why are you bothering this woman  she has done a beautiful thing to me </s>
<s> the poor you will always have with you  but you will not always have me </s>
<s> when she poured this perfume on my body  she did it to prepare me for burial </s>
<s> truly i tell you  wherever this gospel is preached throughout the world  what she has done will also be told  in memory of her  </s>
<s> then one of the twelve  the one called judas iscariot  went to the chief priests</s>
<s> and asked   what are you willing to give me if i deliver him over to you   so they counted out for him thirty pieces of silver </s>
<s> from then on judas watched for an opportunity to hand him over </s>
<s> on the first day of the festival of unleavened bread  the disciples came to jesus and asked   where do you want us to make preparations for you to eat the passover  </s>
<s> he replied   go into the city to a certain man and tell him   the teacher says  my appointed time is near  i am going to celebrate the passover with my disciples at your house   </s>
<s> so the disciples did as jesus had directed them and prepared the passover </s>
<s> when evening came  jesus was reclining at the table with the twelve </s>
<s> and while they were eating  he said   truly i tell you  one of you will betray me  </s>
<s> they were very sad and began to say to him one after the other   surely you dont mean me  lord  </s>
<s> jesus replied   the one who has dipped his hand into the bowl with me will betray me </s>
<s> the son of man will go just as it is written about him  but woe to that man who betrays the son of man  it would be better for him if he had not been born  </s>
<s> then judas  the one who would betray him  said   surely you dont mean me  rabbi   jesus answered   you have said so  </s>
<s> while they were eating  jesus took bread  and when he had given thanks  he broke it and gave it to his disciples  saying   take and eat  this is my body  </s>
<s> then he took a cup  and when he had given thanks  he gave it to them  saying   drink from it  all of you </s>
<s> this is my blood of the covenant  which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins </s>
<s> i tell you  i will not drink from this fruit of the vine from now on until that day when i drink it new with you in my fathers kingdom  </s>
<s> when they had sung a hymn  they went out to the mount of olives </s>
<s> then jesus told them   this very night you will all fall away on account of me  for it is written    i will strike the shepherd  and the sheep of the flock will be scattered  </s>
<s> peter replied   even if all fall away on account of you  i never will  </s>
<s>  truly i tell you   jesus answered   this very night  before the cock crows  you will disown me three times  </s>
<s> but peter declared   even if i have to die with you  i will never disown you   and all the other disciples said the same </s>
<s> then jesus went with his disciples to a place called gethsemane  and he said to them   sit here while i go over there and pray  </s>
<s> he took peter and the two sons of zebedee along with him  and he began to be sorrowful and troubled </s>
<s> then he said to them   my soul is overwhelmed with sorrow to the point of death  stay here and keep watch with me  </s>
<s> going a little farther  he fell with his face to the ground and prayed   my father  if it is possible  may this cup be taken from me  yet not as i will  but as you will  </s>
<s> then he returned to his disciples and found them sleeping   couldnt you men keep watch with me for one hour   he asked peter </s>
<s>  watch and pray so that you will not fall into temptation  the spirit is willing  but the flesh is weak  </s>
<s> he went away a second time and prayed   my father  if it is not possible for this cup to be taken away unless i drink it  may your will be done  </s>
<s> when he came back  he again found them sleeping  because their eyes were heavy </s>
<s> so he left them and went away once more and prayed the third time  saying the same thing </s>
<s> then he returned to the disciples and said to them   are you still sleeping and resting  look  the hour has come  and the son of man is delivered into the hands of sinners </s>
<s> rise  let us go  here comes my betrayer  </s>
<s> while he was still speaking  judas  one of the twelve  arrived  with him was a large crowd armed with swords and clubs  sent from the chief priests and the elders of the people </s>
<s> now the betrayer had arranged a signal with them   the one i kiss is the man  arrest him  </s>
<s> going at once to jesus  judas said   greetings  rabbi   and kissed him </s>
<s> jesus replied   do what you came for  friend   then the men stepped forward  seized jesus and arrested him </s>
<s> with that  one of jesus companions reached for his sword  drew it out and struck the servant of the high priest  cutting off his ear </s>
<s>  put your sword back in its place   jesus said to him   for all who draw the sword will die by the sword </s>
<s> do you think i cannot call on my father  and he will at once put at my disposal more than twelve legions of angels </s>
<s> but how then would the scriptures be fulfilled that say it must happen in this way  </s>
<s> in that hour jesus said to the crowd   am i leading a rebellion  that you have come out with swords and clubs to capture me  every day i sat in the temple courts teaching  and you did not arrest me </s>
<s> but this has all taken place that the writings of the prophets might be fulfilled   then all the disciples deserted him and fled </s>
<s> those who had arrested jesus took him to caiaphas the high priest  where the teachers of the law and the elders had assembled </s>
<s> but peter followed him at a distance  right up to the courtyard of the high priest  he entered and sat down with the guards to see the outcome </s>
<s> the chief priests and the whole sanhedrin were looking for false evidence against jesus so that they could put him to death </s>
<s> but they did not find any  though many false witnesses came forward  finally two came forward</s>
<s> and declared   this fellow said   i am able to destroy the temple of god and rebuild it in three days   </s>
<s> then the high priest stood up and said to jesus   are you not going to answer  what is this testimony that these men are bringing against you  </s>
<s> but jesus remained silent  the high priest said to him   i charge you under oath by the living god  tell us if you are the messiah  the son of god  </s>
<s>  you have said so   jesus replied   but i say to all of you  from now on you will see the son of man sitting at the right hand of the mighty one and coming on the clouds of heaven  </s>
<s> then the high priest tore his clothes and said   he has spoken blasphemy  why do we need any more witnesses  look  now you have heard the blasphemy </s>
<s> what do you think    he is worthy of death   they answered </s>
<s> then they spat in his face and struck him with their fists  others slapped him</s>
<s> and said   prophesy to us  messiah  who hit you  </s>
<s> now peter was sitting out in the courtyard  and a servantgirl came to him   you also were with jesus of galilee   she said </s>
<s> but he denied it before them all   i dont know what youre talking about   he said </s>
<s> then he went out to the gateway  where another servantgirl saw him and said to the people there   this fellow was with jesus of nazareth  </s>
<s> he denied it again  with an oath   i dont know the man  </s>
<s> after a little while  those standing there went up to peter and said   surely you are one of them  your accent gives you away  </s>
<s> then he began to call down curses  and he swore to them   i dont know the man   immediately a cock crowed </s>
<s> then peter remembered the word jesus had spoken   before the cock crows  you will disown me three times   and he went outside and wept bitterly </s>
<s> early in the morning  all the chief priests and the elders of the people made their plans how to have jesus executed </s>
<s> so they bound him  led him away and handed him over to pilate the governor </s>
<s> when judas  who had betrayed him  saw that jesus was condemned  he was seized with remorse and returned the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and the elders </s>
<s>  i have sinned   he said   for i have betrayed innocent blood    what is that to us   they replied   thats your responsibility  </s>
<s> so judas threw the money into the temple and left  then he went away and hanged himself </s>
<s> the chief priests picked up the coins and said   it is against the law to put this into the treasury  since it is blood money  </s>
<s> so they decided to use the money to buy the potters field as a burial place for foreigners </s>
<s> that is why it has been called the field of blood to this day </s>
<s> then what was spoken by jeremiah the prophet was fulfilled   they took the thirty pieces of silver  the price set on him by the people of israel </s>
<s> and they used them to buy the potters field  as the lord commanded me  </s>
<s> meanwhile jesus stood before the governor  and the governor asked him   are you the king of the jews    you have said so   jesus replied </s>
<s> when he was accused by the chief priests and the elders  he gave no answer </s>
<s> then pilate asked him   dont you hear the testimony they are bringing against you  </s>
<s> but jesus made no reply  not even to a single charge  to the great amazement of the governor </s>
<s> now it was the governors custom at the festival to release a prisoner chosen by the crowd </s>
<s> at that time they had a wellknown prisoner whose name was jesus barabbas </s>
<s> so when the crowd had gathered  pilate asked them   which one do you want me to release to you  jesus barabbas  or jesus who is called the messiah  </s>
<s> for he knew it was out of selfinterest that they had handed jesus over to him </s>
<s> while pilate was sitting on the judges seat  his wife sent him this message   dont have anything to do with that innocent man  for i have suffered a great deal today in a dream because of him  </s>
<s> but the chief priests and the elders persuaded the crowd to ask for barabbas and to have jesus executed </s>
<s>  which of the two do you want me to release to you   asked the governor   barabbas   they answered </s>
<s>  what shall i do  then  with jesus who is called the messiah   pilate asked  they all answered   crucify him  </s>
<s>  why  what crime has he committed   asked pilate  but they shouted all the louder   crucify him  </s>
<s> when pilate saw that he was getting nowhere  but that instead an uproar was starting  he took water and washed his hands in front of the crowd   i am innocent of this mans blood   he said   it is your responsibility  </s>
<s> all the people answered   his blood is on us and on our children  </s>
<s> then he released barabbas to them  but he had jesus flogged  and handed him over to be crucified </s>
<s> then the governors soldiers took jesus into the praetorium and gathered the whole company of soldiers round him </s>
<s> they stripped him and put a scarlet robe on him </s>
<s> and then twisted together a crown of thorns and set it on his head  they put a staff in his right hand  then they knelt in front of him and mocked him   hail  king of the jews   they said </s>
<s> they spat on him  and took the staff and struck him on the head again and again </s>
<s> after they had mocked him  they took off the robe and put his own clothes on him  then they led him away to crucify him </s>
<s> as they were going out  they met a man from cyrene  named simon  and they forced him to carry the cross </s>
<s> they came to a place called golgotha  which means  the place of the skull  </s>
<s> there they offered jesus wine to drink  mixed with gall  but after tasting it  he refused to drink it </s>
<s> when they had crucified him  they divided up his clothes by casting lots </s>
<s> and sitting down  they kept watch over him there </s>
<s> above his head they placed the written charge against him  this is jesus  the king of the jews </s>
<s> two rebels were crucified with him  one on his right and one on his left </s>
<s> those who passed by hurled insults at him  shaking their heads</s>
<s> and saying   you who are going to destroy the temple and build it in three days  save yourself  come down from the cross  if you are the son of god  </s>
<s> in the same way the chief priests  the teachers of the law and the elders mocked him </s>
<s>  he saved others   they said   but he cant save himself  hes the king of israel  let him come down now from the cross  and we will believe in him </s>
<s> he trusts in god  let god rescue him now if he wants him  for he said   i am the son of god   </s>
<s> in the same way the rebels who were crucified with him also heaped insults on him </s>
<s> from noon until three in the afternoon darkness came over all the land </s>
<s> about three in the afternoon jesus cried out in a loud voice   eli  eli  lema sabachthani    which means  my god  my god  why have you forsaken me    </s>
<s> when some of those standing there heard this  they said   hes calling elijah  </s>
<s> immediately one of them ran and got a sponge  he filled it with wine vinegar  put it on a staff  and offered it to jesus to drink </s>
<s> the rest said   now leave him alone  lets see if elijah comes to save him  </s>
<s> and when jesus had cried out again in a loud voice  he gave up his spirit </s>
<s> at that moment the curtain of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom  the earth shook  the rocks split</s>
<s> and the tombs broke open  the bodies of many holy people who had died were raised to life </s>
<s> they came out of the tombs after jesus resurrection and went into the holy city and appeared to many people </s>
<s> when the centurion and those with him who were guarding jesus saw the earthquake and all that had happened  they were terrified  and exclaimed   surely he was the son of god  </s>
<s> many women were there  watching from a distance  they had followed jesus from galilee to care for his needs </s>
<s> among them were mary magdalene  mary the mother of james and joseph  and the mother of zebedees sons </s>
<s> as evening approached  there came a rich man from arimathea  named joseph  who had himself become a disciple of jesus </s>
<s> going to pilate  he asked for jesus body  and pilate ordered that it be given to him </s>
<s> joseph took the body  wrapped it in a clean linen cloth </s>
<s> and placed it in his own new tomb that he had cut out of the rock  he rolled a big stone in front of the entrance to the tomb and went away </s>
<s> mary magdalene and the other mary were sitting there opposite the tomb </s>
<s> the next day  the one after preparation day  the chief priests and the pharisees went to pilate </s>
<s>  sir   they said   we remember that while he was still alive that deceiver said   after three days i will rise again  </s>
<s> so give the order for the tomb to be made secure until the third day  otherwise  his disciples may come and steal the body and tell the people that he has been raised from the dead  this last deception will be worse than the first  </s>
<s>  take a guard   pilate answered   go  make the tomb as secure as you know how  </s>
<s> so they went and made the tomb secure by putting a seal on the stone and posting the guard </s>
<s> after the sabbath  at dawn on the first day of the week  mary magdalene and the other mary went to look at the tomb </s>
<s> there was a violent earthquake  for an angel of the lord came down from heaven and  going to the tomb  rolled back the stone and sat on it </s>
<s> his appearance was like lightning  and his clothes were white as snow </s>
<s> the guards were so afraid of him that they shook and became like dead men </s>
<s> the angel said to the women   do not be afraid  for i know that you are looking for jesus  who was crucified </s>
<s> he is not here  he has risen  just as he said  come and see the place where he lay </s>
<s> then go quickly and tell his disciples   he has risen from the dead and is going ahead of you into galilee  there you will see him   now i have told you  </s>
<s> so the women hurried away from the tomb  afraid yet filled with joy  and ran to tell his disciples </s>
<s> suddenly jesus met them   greetings   he said  they came to him  clasped his feet and worshipped him </s>
<s> then jesus said to them   do not be afraid  go and tell my brothers to go to galilee  there they will see me  </s>
<s> while the women were on their way  some of the guards went into the city and reported to the chief priests everything that had happened </s>
<s> when the chief priests had met with the elders and devised a plan  they gave the soldiers a large sum of money </s>
<s> telling them   you are to say   his disciples came during the night and stole him away while we were asleep  </s>
<s> if this report gets to the governor  we will satisfy him and keep you out of trouble  </s>
<s> so the soldiers took the money and did as they were instructed  and this story has been widely circulated among the jews to this very day </s>
<s> then the eleven disciples went to galilee  to the mountain where jesus had told them to go </s>
<s> when they saw him  they worshipped him  but some doubted </s>
<s> then jesus came to them and said   all authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me </s>
<s> therefore go and make disciples of all nations  baptising them in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy spirit </s>
<s> and teaching them to obey everything i have commanded you  and surely i am with you always  to the very end of the age  </s>
<s> the beginning of the good news about jesus the messiah  the son of god </s>
<s> as it is written in isaiah the prophet   i will send my messenger ahead of you  who will prepare your way </s>
<s>  a voice of one calling in the wilderness   prepare the way for the lord  make straight paths for him   </s>
<s> at that time jesus came from nazareth in galilee and was baptised by john in the jordan </s>
<s> just as jesus was coming up out of the water  he saw heaven being torn open and the spirit descending on him like a dove </s>
<s> and a voice came from heaven   you are my son  whom i love  with you i am well pleased  </s>
<s> at once the spirit sent him out into the wilderness </s>
<s> and he was in the wilderness for forty days  being tempted by satan  he was with the wild animals  and angels attended him </s>
<s> after john was put in prison  jesus went into galilee  proclaiming the good news of god </s>
<s>  the time has come   he said   the kingdom of god has come near  repent and believe the good news  </s>
<s> as jesus walked beside the sea of galilee  he saw simon and his brother andrew casting a net into the lake  for they were fishermen </s>
<s>  come  follow me   jesus said   and i will send you out to fish for people  </s>
<s> at once they left their nets and followed him </s>
<s> when he had gone a little farther  he saw james son of zebedee and his brother john in a boat  preparing their nets </s>
<s> without delay he called them  and they left their father zebedee in the boat with the hired men and followed him </s>
<s> they went to capernaum  and when the sabbath came  jesus went into the synagogue and began to teach </s>
<s> the people were amazed at his teaching  because he taught them as one who had authority  not as the teachers of the law </s>
<s> just then a man in their synagogue who was possessed by an impure spirit cried out </s>
<s>  what do you want with us  jesus of nazareth  have you come to destroy us  i know who you are  the holy one of god  </s>
<s>  be quiet   said jesus sternly   come out of him  </s>
<s> the impure spirit shook the man violently and came out of him with a shriek </s>
<s> the people were all so amazed that they asked each other   what is this  a new teaching  and with authority  he even gives orders to impure spirits and they obey him  </s>
<s> news about him spread quickly over the whole region of galilee </s>
<s> as soon as they left the synagogue  they went with james and john to the home of simon and andrew </s>
<s> simons motherinlaw was in bed with a fever  and they immediately told jesus about her </s>
<s> so he went to her  took her hand and helped her up  the fever left her and she began to wait on them </s>
<s> that evening after sunset the people brought to jesus all who were ill and demonpossessed </s>
<s> the whole town gathered at the door </s>
<s> and jesus healed many who had various diseases  he also drove out many demons  but he would not let the demons speak because they knew who he was </s>
<s> very early in the morning  while it was still dark  jesus got up  left the house and went off to a solitary place  where he prayed </s>
<s> simon and his companions went to look for him </s>
<s> and when they found him  they exclaimed   everyone is looking for you  </s>
<s> jesus replied   let us go somewhere else  to the nearby villages  so that i can preach there also  that is why i have come  </s>
<s> so he travelled throughout galilee  preaching in their synagogues and driving out demons </s>
<s> a man with leprosy came to him and begged him on his knees   if you are willing  you can make me clean  </s>
<s> jesus was indignant  he reached out his hand and touched the man   i am willing   he said   be clean  </s>
<s> immediately the leprosy left him and he was cleansed </s>
<s> jesus sent him away at once with a strong warning </s>
<s>  see that you dont tell this to anyone  but go  show yourself to the priest and offer the sacrifices that moses commanded for your cleansing  as a testimony to them  </s>
<s> instead he went out and began to talk freely  spreading the news  as a result  jesus could no longer enter a town openly but stayed outside in lonely places  yet the people still came to him from everywhere </s>
<s> a few days later  when jesus again entered capernaum  the people heard that he had come home </s>
<s> they gathered in such large numbers that there was no room left  not even outside the door  and he preached the word to them </s>
<s> some men came  bringing to him a paralysed man  carried by four of them </s>
<s> since they could not get him to jesus because of the crowd  they made an opening in the roof above jesus by digging through it and then lowered the mat the man was lying on </s>
<s> when jesus saw their faith  he said to the paralysed man   son  your sins are forgiven  </s>
<s> now some teachers of the law were sitting there  thinking to themselves </s>
<s>  why does this fellow talk like that  hes blaspheming  who can forgive sins but god alone  </s>
<s> immediately jesus knew in his spirit that this was what they were thinking in their hearts  and he said to them   why are you thinking these things </s>
<s> which is easier  to say to this paralysed man   your sins are forgiven   or to say   get up  take your mat and walk  </s>
<s> but i want you to know that the son of man has authority on earth to forgive sins   so he said to the man </s>
<s>  i tell you  get up  take your mat and go home  </s>
<s> he got up  took his mat and walked out in full view of them all  this amazed everyone and they praised god  saying   we have never seen anything like this  </s>
<s> once again jesus went out beside the lake  a large crowd came to him  and he began to teach them </s>
<s> as he walked along  he saw levi son of alphaeus sitting at the tax collectors booth   follow me   jesus told him  and levi got up and followed him </s>
<s> while jesus was having dinner at levis house  many tax collectors and sinners were eating with him and his disciples  for there were many who followed him </s>
<s> when the teachers of the law who were pharisees saw him eating with the sinners and tax collectors  they asked his disciples   why does he eat with tax collectors and sinners  </s>
<s> on hearing this  jesus said to them   it is not the healthy who need a doctor  but those who are ill  i have not come to call the righteous  but sinners  </s>
<s> now johns disciples and the pharisees were fasting  some people came and asked jesus   how is it that johns disciples and the disciples of the pharisees are fasting  but yours are not  </s>
<s> jesus answered   how can the guests of the bridegroom fast while he is with them  they cannot  so long as they have him with them </s>
<s> but the time will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them  and on that day they will fast </s>
<s>  no one sews a patch of unshrunk cloth on an old garment  otherwise  the new piece will pull away from the old  making the tear worse </s>
<s> and no one pours new wine into old wineskins  otherwise  the wine will burst the skins  and both the wine and the wineskins will be ruined  no  they pour new wine into new wineskins  </s>
<s> one sabbath jesus was going through the cornfields  and as his disciples walked along  they began to pick some ears of corn </s>
<s> the pharisees said to him   look  why are they doing what is unlawful on the sabbath  </s>
<s> he answered   have you never read what david did when he and his companions were hungry and in need </s>
<s> in the days of abiathar the high priest  he entered the house of god and ate the consecrated bread  which is lawful only for priests to eat  and he also gave some to his companions  </s>
<s> then he said to them   the sabbath was made for man  not man for the sabbath </s>
<s> so the son of man is lord even of the sabbath  </s>
<s> another time jesus went into the synagogue  and a man with a shrivelled hand was there </s>
<s> some of them were looking for a reason to accuse jesus  so they watched him closely to see if he would heal him on the sabbath </s>
<s> jesus said to the man with the shrivelled hand   stand up in front of everyone  </s>
<s> then jesus asked them   which is lawful on the sabbath  to do good or to do evil  to save life or to kill   but they remained silent </s>
<s> he looked around at them in anger and  deeply distressed at their stubborn hearts  said to the man   stretch out your hand   he stretched it out  and his hand was completely restored </s>
<s> then the pharisees went out and began to plot with the herodians how they might kill jesus </s>
<s> jesus withdrew with his disciples to the lake  and a large crowd from galilee followed </s>
<s> when they heard all he was doing  many people came to him from judea  jerusalem  idumea  and the regions across the jordan and around tyre and sidon </s>
<s> because of the crowd he told his disciples to have a small boat ready for him  to keep the people from crowding him </s>
<s> for he had healed many  so that those with diseases were pushing forward to touch him </s>
<s> whenever the impure spirits saw him  they fell down before him and cried out   you are the son of god  </s>
<s> but he gave them strict orders not to tell others about him </s>
<s> jesus went up on a mountainside and called to him those he wanted  and they came to him </s>
<s> he appointed twelve that they might be with him and that he might send them out to preach</s>
<s> and to have authority to drive out demons </s>
<s> these are the twelve he appointed  simon  to whom he gave the name peter  </s>
<s> james son of zebedee and his brother john  to them he gave the name boanerges  which means  sons of thunder  </s>
<s> andrew  philip  bartholomew  matthew  thomas  james son of alphaeus  thaddaeus  simon the zealot</s>
<s> and judas iscariot  who betrayed him </s>
<s> then jesus entered a house  and again a crowd gathered  so that he and his disciples were not even able to eat </s>
<s> when his family heard about this  they went to take charge of him  for they said   he is out of his mind  </s>
<s> and the teachers of the law who came down from jerusalem said   he is possessed by beelzebul  by the prince of demons he is driving out demons  </s>
<s> so jesus called them over to him and began to speak to them in parables   how can satan drive out satan </s>
<s> if a kingdom is divided against itself  that kingdom cannot stand </s>
<s> if a house is divided against itself  that house cannot stand </s>
<s> and if satan opposes himself and is divided  he cannot stand  his end has come </s>
<s> in fact  no one can enter a strong mans house without first tying him up  then he can plunder the strong mans house </s>
<s> truly i tell you  people can be forgiven all their sins and every slander they utter </s>
<s> but whoever blasphemes against the holy spirit will never be forgiven  they are guilty of an eternal sin  </s>
<s> he said this because they were saying   he has an impure spirit  </s>
<s> then jesus mother and brothers arrived  standing outside  they sent someone in to call him </s>
<s> a crowd was sitting round him  and they told him   your mother and brothers are outside looking for you  </s>
<s>  who are my mother and my brothers   he asked </s>
<s> then he looked at those seated in a circle round him and said   here are my mother and my brothers </s>
<s> whoever does gods will is my brother and sister and mother  </s>
<s> again jesus began to teach by the lake  the crowd that gathered round him was so large that he got into a boat and sat in it out on the lake  while all the people were along the shore at the waters edge </s>
<s> he taught them many things by parables  and in his teaching said </s>
<s>  listen  a farmer went out to sow his seed </s>
<s> as he was scattering the seed  some fell along the path  and the birds came and ate it up </s>
<s> some fell on rocky places  where it did not have much soil  it sprang up quickly  because the soil was shallow </s>
<s> but when the sun came up  the plants were scorched  and they withered because they had no root </s>
<s> other seed fell among thorns  which grew up and choked the plants  so that they did not bear grain </s>
<s> still other seed fell on good soil  it came up  grew and produced a crop  some multiplying thirty  some sixty  some a hundred times  </s>
<s> then jesus said   whoever has ears to hear  let them hear  </s>
<s> when he was alone  the twelve and the others around him asked him about the parables </s>
<s> he told them   the secret of the kingdom of god has been given to you  but to those on the outside everything is said in parables</s>
<s> so that    they may be ever seeing but never perceiving  and ever hearing but never understanding  otherwise they might turn and be forgiven   </s>
<s> then jesus said to them   dont you understand this parable  how then will you understand any parable </s>
<s> the farmer sows the word </s>
<s> some people are like seed along the path  where the word is sown  as soon as they hear it  satan comes and takes away the word that was sown in them </s>
<s> others  like seed sown on rocky places  hear the word and at once receive it with joy </s>
<s> but since they have no root  they last only a short time  when trouble or persecution comes because of the word  they quickly fall away </s>
<s> still others  like seed sown among thorns  hear the word </s>
<s> but the worries of this life  the deceitfulness of wealth and the desires for other things come in and choke the word  making it unfruitful </s>
<s> others  like seed sown on good soil  hear the word  accept it  and produce a crop  some thirty  some sixty  some a hundred times what was sown  </s>
<s> he said to them   do you bring in a lamp to put it under a bowl or a bed  instead  dont you put it on its stand </s>
<s> for whatever is hidden is meant to be disclosed  and whatever is concealed is meant to be brought out into the open </s>
<s> if anyone has ears to hear  let them hear  </s>
<s>  consider carefully what you hear   he continued   with the measure you use  it will be measured to you  and even more </s>
<s> whoever has will be given more  whoever does not have  even what they have will be taken from them  </s>
<s> he also said   this is what the kingdom of god is like  a man scatters seed on the ground </s>
<s> night and day  whether he sleeps or gets up  the seed sprouts and grows  though he does not know how </s>
<s> all by itself the soil produces corn  first the stalk  then the ear  then the full grain in the ear </s>
<s> as soon as the corn is ripe  he puts the sickle to it  because the harvest has come  </s>
<s> again he said   what shall we say the kingdom of god is like  or what parable shall we use to describe it </s>
<s> it is like a mustard seed  which is the smallest of all seeds on earth </s>
<s> yet when planted  it grows and becomes the largest of all garden plants  with such big branches that the birds can perch in its shade  </s>
<s> with many similar parables jesus spoke the word to them  as much as they could understand </s>
<s> he did not say anything to them without using a parable  but when he was alone with his own disciples  he explained everything </s>
<s> that day when evening came  he said to his disciples   let us go over to the other side  </s>
<s> leaving the crowd behind  they took him along  just as he was  in the boat  there were also other boats with him </s>
<s> a furious squall came up  and the waves broke over the boat  so that it was nearly swamped </s>
<s> jesus was in the stern  sleeping on a cushion  the disciples woke him and said to him   teacher  dont you care if we drown  </s>
<s> he got up  rebuked the wind and said to the waves   quiet  be still   then the wind died down and it was completely calm </s>
<s> he said to his disciples   why are you so afraid  do you still have no faith  </s>
<s> they were terrified and asked each other   who is this  even the wind and the waves obey him  </s>
<s> they went across the lake to the region of the gerasenes </s>
<s> when jesus got out of the boat  a man with an impure spirit came from the tombs to meet him </s>
<s> this man lived in the tombs  and no one could bind him anymore  not even with a chain </s>
<s> for he had often been chained hand and foot  but he tore the chains apart and broke the irons on his feet  no one was strong enough to subdue him </s>
<s> night and day among the tombs and in the hills he would cry out and cut himself with stones </s>
<s> when he saw jesus from a distance  he ran and fell on his knees in front of him </s>
<s> he shouted at the top of his voice   what do you want with me  jesus  son of the most high god  in gods name dont torture me  </s>
<s> for jesus had said to him   come out of this man  you impure spirit  </s>
<s> then jesus asked him   what is your name    my name is legion   he replied   for we are many  </s>
<s> and he begged jesus again and again not to send them out of the area </s>
<s> a large herd of pigs was feeding on the nearby hillside </s>
<s> the demons begged jesus   send us among the pigs  allow us to go into them  </s>
<s> he gave them permission  and the impure spirits came out and went into the pigs  the herd  about two thousand in number  rushed down the steep bank into the lake and were drowned </s>
<s> those tending the pigs ran off and reported this in the town and countryside  and the people went out to see what had happened </s>
<s> when they came to jesus  they saw the man who had been possessed by the legion of demons  sitting there  dressed and in his right mind  and they were afraid </s>
<s> those who had seen it told the people what had happened to the demonpossessed man  and told about the pigs as well </s>
<s> then the people began to plead with jesus to leave their region </s>
<s> as jesus was getting into the boat  the man who had been demonpossessed begged to go with him </s>
<s> jesus did not let him  but said   go home to your own people and tell them how much the lord has done for you  and how he has had mercy on you  </s>
<s> so the man went away and began to tell in the decapolis how much jesus had done for him  and all the people were amazed </s>
<s> when jesus had again crossed over by boat to the other side of the lake  a large crowd gathered round him while he was by the lake </s>
<s> then one of the synagogue leaders  named jairus  came  and when he saw jesus  he fell at his feet </s>
<s> he pleaded earnestly with him   my little daughter is dying  please come and put your hands on her so that she will be healed and live  </s>
<s> so jesus went with him  a large crowd followed and pressed round him </s>
<s> and a woman was there who had been subject to bleeding for twelve years </s>
<s> she had suffered a great deal under the care of many doctors and had spent all she had  yet instead of getting better she grew worse </s>
<s> when she heard about jesus  she came up behind him in the crowd and touched his cloak </s>
<s> because she thought   if i just touch his clothes  i will be healed  </s>
<s> immediately her bleeding stopped and she felt in her body that she was freed from her suffering </s>
<s> at once jesus realised that power had gone out from him  he turned round in the crowd and asked   who touched my clothes  </s>
<s>  you see the people crowding against you   his disciples answered   and yet you can ask   who touched me   </s>
<s> but jesus kept looking around to see who had done it </s>
<s> then the woman  knowing what had happened to her  came and fell at his feet and  trembling with fear  told him the whole truth </s>
<s> he said to her   daughter  your faith has healed you  go in peace and be freed from your suffering  </s>
<s> while jesus was still speaking  some people came from the house of jairus  the synagogue leader   your daughter is dead   they said   why bother the teacher anymore  </s>
<s> overhearing what they said  jesus told him   dont be afraid  just believe  </s>
<s> he did not let anyone follow him except peter  james and john the brother of james </s>
<s> when they came to the home of the synagogue leader  jesus saw a commotion  with people crying and wailing loudly </s>
<s> he went in and said to them   why all this commotion and wailing  the child is not dead but asleep  </s>
<s> but they laughed at him  after he put them all out  he took the childs father and mother and the disciples who were with him  and went in where the child was </s>
<s> he took her by the hand and said to her   talitha koum    which means  little girl  i say to you  get up    </s>
<s> immediately the girl stood up and began to walk around  she was twelve years old   at this they were completely astonished </s>
<s> he gave strict orders not to let anyone know about this  and told them to give her something to eat </s>
<s> jesus left there and went to his home town  accompanied by his disciples </s>
<s> when the sabbath came  he began to teach in the synagogue  and many who heard him were amazed   where did this man get these things   they asked   whats this wisdom that has been given him  what are these remarkable miracles he is performing </s>
<s> isnt this the carpenter  isnt this marys son and the brother of james  joseph  judas and simon  arent his sisters here with us   and they took offence at him </s>
<s> jesus said to them   a prophet is not without honour except in his own town  among his relatives and in his own home  </s>
<s> he could not do any miracles there  except lay his hands on a few people who were ill and heal them </s>
<s> he was amazed at their lack of faith  then jesus went around teaching from village to village </s>
<s> calling the twelve to him  he began to send them out two by two and gave them authority over impure spirits </s>
<s> these were his instructions   take nothing for the journey except a staff  no bread  no bag  no money in your belts </s>
<s> wear sandals but not an extra shirt </s>
<s> whenever you enter a house  stay there until you leave that town </s>
<s> and if any place will not welcome you or listen to you  leave that place and shake the dust off your feet as a testimony against them  </s>
<s> they went out and preached that people should repent </s>
<s> they drove out many demons and anointed with oil many people who were ill and healed them </s>
<s> king herod heard about this  for jesus name had become well known  some were saying   john the baptist has been raised from the dead  and that is why miraculous powers are at work in him  </s>
<s> others said   he is elijah   and still others claimed   he is a prophet  like one of the prophets of long ago  </s>
<s> but when herod heard this  he said   john  whom i beheaded  has been raised from the dead  </s>
<s> for herod himself had given orders to have john arrested  and he had him bound and put in prison  he did this because of herodias  his brother philips wife  whom he had married </s>
<s> for john had been saying to herod   it is not lawful for you to have your brothers wife  </s>
<s> so herodias nursed a grudge against john and wanted to kill him  but she was not able to </s>
<s> because herod feared john and protected him  knowing him to be a righteous and holy man  when herod heard john  he was greatly puzzled  yet he liked to listen to him </s>
<s> finally the opportune time came  on his birthday herod gave a banquet for his high officials and military commanders and the leading men of galilee </s>
<s> when the daughter of herodias came in and danced  she pleased herod and his dinner guests  the king said to the girl   ask me for anything you want  and ill give it to you  </s>
<s> and he promised her with an oath   whatever you ask i will give you  up to half my kingdom  </s>
<s> she went out and said to her mother   what shall i ask for    the head of john the baptist   she answered </s>
<s> at once the girl hurried in to the king with the request   i want you to give me right now the head of john the baptist on a dish  </s>
<s> the king was greatly distressed  but because of his oaths and his dinner guests  he did not want to refuse her </s>
<s> so he immediately sent an executioner with orders to bring johns head  the man went  beheaded john in the prison </s>
<s> and brought back his head on a dish  he presented it to the girl  and she gave it to her mother </s>
<s> on hearing of this  johns disciples came and took his body and laid it in a tomb </s>
<s> the apostles gathered round jesus and reported to him all they had done and taught </s>
<s> then  because so many people were coming and going that they did not even have a chance to eat  he said to them   come with me by yourselves to a quiet place and get some rest  </s>
<s> so they went away by themselves in a boat to a solitary place </s>
<s> but many who saw them leaving recognised them and ran on foot from all the towns and got there ahead of them </s>
<s> when jesus landed and saw a large crowd  he had compassion on them  because they were like sheep without a shepherd  so he began teaching them many things </s>
<s> by this time it was late in the day  so his disciples came to him   this is a remote place   they said   and its already very late </s>
<s> send the people away so that they can go to the surrounding countryside and villages and buy themselves something to eat  </s>
<s> but he answered   you give them something to eat   they said to him   that would take more than half a years wages  are we to go and spend that much on bread and give it to them to eat  </s>
<s>  how many loaves do you have   he asked   go and see   when they found out  they said   five  and two fish  </s>
<s> then jesus told them to make all the people sit down in groups on the green grass </s>
<s> so they sat down in groups of hundreds and fifties </s>
<s> taking the five loaves and the two fish and looking up to heaven  he gave thanks and broke the loaves  then he gave them to his disciples to distribute to the people  he also divided the two fish among them all </s>
<s> they all ate and were satisfied </s>
<s> and the disciples picked up twelve basketfuls of broken pieces of bread and fish </s>
<s> the number of the men who had eaten was five thousand </s>
<s> immediately jesus made his disciples get into the boat and go on ahead of him to bethsaida  while he dismissed the crowd </s>
<s> after leaving them  he went up on a mountainside to pray </s>
<s> later that night  the boat was in the middle of the lake  and he was alone on land </s>
<s> he saw the disciples straining at the oars  because the wind was against them  shortly before dawn he went out to them  walking on the lake  he was about to pass by them </s>
<s> but when they saw him walking on the lake  they thought he was a ghost  they cried out </s>
<s> because they all saw him and were terrified  immediately he spoke to them and said   take courage  it is i  dont be afraid  </s>
<s> then he climbed into the boat with them  and the wind died down  they were completely amazed </s>
<s> for they had not understood about the loaves  their hearts were hardened </s>
<s> when they had crossed over  they landed at gennesaret and anchored there </s>
<s> as soon as they got out of the boat  people recognised jesus </s>
<s> they ran throughout that whole region and carried those who were ill on mats to wherever they heard he was </s>
<s> and wherever he went  into villages  towns or countryside  they placed those who were ill in the marketplaces  they begged him to let them touch even the edge of his cloak  and all who touched it were healed </s>
<s> the pharisees and some of the teachers of the law who had come from jerusalem gathered round jesus</s>
<s> and saw some of his disciples eating food with hands that were defiled  that is  unwashed </s>
<s>  the pharisees and all the jews do not eat unless they give their hands a ceremonial washing  holding to the tradition of the elders </s>
<s> when they come from the marketplace they do not eat unless they wash  and they observe many other traditions  such as the washing of cups  pitchers and kettles  </s>
<s> so the pharisees and teachers of the law asked jesus   why dont your disciples live according to the tradition of the elders instead of eating their food with defiled hands  </s>
<s> he replied   isaiah was right when he prophesied about you hypocrites  as it is written    these people honour me with their lips  but their hearts are far from me </s>
<s> they worship me in vain  their teachings are merely human rules  </s>
<s> and he continued   you have a fine way of setting aside the commands of god in order to observe your own traditions </s>
<s> for moses said   honour your father and mother   and   anyone who curses their father or mother is to be put to death  </s>
<s> but you say that if anyone declares that what might have been used to help their father or mother is corban  that is  devoted to god  </s>
<s> then you no longer let them do anything for their father or mother </s>
<s> thus you nullify the word of god by your tradition that you have handed down  and you do many things like that  </s>
<s> again jesus called the crowd to him and said   listen to me  everyone  and understand this </s>
<s> nothing outside a person can defile them by going into them  rather  it is what comes out of a person that defiles them   </s>
<s> </s>
<s> after he had left the crowd and entered the house  his disciples asked him about this parable </s>
<s>  are you so dull   he asked   dont you see that nothing that enters a person from the outside can defile them </s>
<s> for it doesnt go into their heart but into their stomach  and then out of the body    in saying this  jesus declared all foods clean  </s>
<s> he went on   what comes out of a person is what defiles them </s>
<s> for it is from within  out of a persons heart  that evil thoughts come  sexual immorality  theft  murder </s>
<s> adultery  greed  malice  deceit  lewdness  envy  slander  arrogance and folly </s>
<s> all these evils come from inside and defile a person  </s>
<s> jesus left that place and went to the vicinity of tyre  he entered a house and did not want anyone to know it  yet he could not keep his presence secret </s>
<s> in fact  as soon as she heard about him  a woman whose little daughter was possessed by an impure spirit came and fell at his feet </s>
<s> the woman was a greek  born in syrian phoenicia  she begged jesus to drive the demon out of her daughter </s>
<s>  first let the children eat all they want   he told her   for it is not right to take the childrens bread and toss it to the dogs  </s>
<s>  lord   she replied   even the dogs under the table eat the childrens crumbs  </s>
<s> then he told her   for such a reply  you may go  the demon has left your daughter  </s>
<s> she went home and found her child lying on the bed  and the demon gone </s>
<s> then jesus left the vicinity of tyre and went through sidon  down to the sea of galilee and into the region of the decapolis </s>
<s> there some people brought to him a man who was deaf and could hardly talk  and they begged jesus to place his hand on him </s>
<s> after he took him aside  away from the crowd  jesus put his fingers into the mans ears  then he spat and touched the mans tongue </s>
<s> he looked up to heaven and with a deep sigh said to him   ephphatha    which means  be opened    </s>
<s> at this  the mans ears were opened  his tongue was loosed and he began to speak plainly </s>
<s> jesus commanded them not to tell anyone  but the more he did so  the more they kept talking about it </s>
<s> people were overwhelmed with amazement   he has done everything well   they said   he even makes the deaf hear and the mute speak  </s>
<s> during those days another large crowd gathered  since they had nothing to eat  jesus called his disciples to him and said </s>
<s>  i have compassion for these people  they have already been with me three days and have nothing to eat </s>
<s> if i send them home hungry  they will collapse on the way  because some of them have come a long distance  </s>
<s> his disciples answered   but where in this remote place can anyone get enough bread to feed them  </s>
<s>  how many loaves do you have   jesus asked   seven   they replied </s>
<s> he told the crowd to sit down on the ground  when he had taken the seven loaves and given thanks  he broke them and gave them to his disciples to distribute to the people  and they did so </s>
<s> they had a few small fish as well  he gave thanks for them also and told the disciples to distribute them </s>
<s> the people ate and were satisfied  afterwards the disciples picked up seven basketfuls of broken pieces that were left over </s>
<s> about four thousand were present  after he had sent them away </s>
<s> he got into the boat with his disciples and went to the region of dalmanutha </s>
<s> the pharisees came and began to question jesus  to test him  they asked him for a sign from heaven </s>
<s> he sighed deeply and said   why does this generation ask for a sign  truly i tell you  no sign will be given to it  </s>
<s> then he left them  got back into the boat and crossed to the other side </s>
<s> the disciples had forgotten to bring bread  except for one loaf they had with them in the boat </s>
<s>  be careful   jesus warned them   watch out for the yeast of the pharisees and that of herod  </s>
<s> they discussed this with one another and said   it is because we have no bread  </s>
<s> aware of their discussion  jesus asked them   why are you talking about having no bread  do you still not see or understand  are your hearts hardened </s>
<s> do you have eyes but fail to see  and ears but fail to hear  and dont you remember </s>
<s> when i broke the five loaves for the five thousand  how many basketfuls of pieces did you pick up    twelve   they replied </s>
<s>  and when i broke the seven loaves for the four thousand  how many basketfuls of pieces did you pick up   they answered   seven  </s>
<s> he said to them   do you still not understand  </s>
<s> they came to bethsaida  and some people brought a blind man and begged jesus to touch him </s>
<s> he took the blind man by the hand and led him outside the village  when he had spat on the mans eyes and put his hands on him  jesus asked   do you see anything  </s>
<s> he looked up and said   i see people  they look like trees walking around  </s>
<s> once more jesus put his hands on the mans eyes  then his eyes were opened  his sight was restored  and he saw everything clearly </s>
<s> jesus sent him home  saying   dont even go into the village  </s>
<s> jesus and his disciples went on to the villages around caesarea philippi  on the way he asked them   who do people say i am  </s>
<s> they replied   some say john the baptist  others say elijah  and still others  one of the prophets  </s>
<s>  but what about you   he asked   who do you say i am   peter answered   you are the messiah  </s>
<s> jesus warned them not to tell anyone about him </s>
<s> he then began to teach them that the son of man must suffer many things and be rejected by the elders  the chief priests and the teachers of the law  and that he must be killed and after three days rise again </s>
<s> he spoke plainly about this  and peter took him aside and began to rebuke him </s>
<s> but when jesus turned and looked at his disciples  he rebuked peter   get behind me  satan   he said   you do not have in mind the concerns of god  but merely human concerns  </s>
<s> then he called the crowd to him along with his disciples and said   whoever wants to be my disciple must deny themselves and take up their cross and follow me </s>
<s> for whoever wants to save their life will lose it  but whoever loses their life for me and for the gospel will save it </s>
<s> what good is it for someone to gain the whole world  yet forfeit their soul </s>
<s> or what can anyone give in exchange for their soul </s>
<s> if anyone is ashamed of me and my words in this adulterous and sinful generation  the son of man will be ashamed of them when he comes in his fathers glory with the holy angels  </s>
<s> and he said to them   truly i tell you  some who are standing here will not taste death before they see that the kingdom of god has come with power  </s>
<s> after six days jesus took peter  james and john with him and led them up a high mountain  where they were all alone  there he was transfigured before them </s>
<s> his clothes became dazzling white  whiter than anyone in the world could bleach them </s>
<s> and there appeared before them elijah and moses  who were talking with jesus </s>
<s> peter said to jesus   rabbi  it is good for us to be here  let us put up three shelters  one for you  one for moses and one for elijah  </s>
<s>  he did not know what to say  they were so frightened  </s>
<s> then a cloud appeared and covered them  and a voice came from the cloud   this is my son  whom i love  listen to him  </s>
<s> suddenly  when they looked around  they no longer saw anyone with them except jesus </s>
<s> as they were coming down the mountain  jesus gave them orders not to tell anyone what they had seen until the son of man had risen from the dead </s>
<s> they kept the matter to themselves  discussing what  rising from the dead meant </s>
<s> and they asked him   why do the teachers of the law say that elijah must come first  </s>
<s> jesus replied   to be sure  elijah does come first  and restores all things  why then is it written that the son of man must suffer much and be rejected </s>
<s> but i tell you  elijah has come  and they have done to him everything they wished  just as it is written about him  </s>
<s> when they came to the other disciples  they saw a large crowd around them and the teachers of the law arguing with them </s>
<s> as soon as all the people saw jesus  they were overwhelmed with wonder and ran to greet him </s>
<s>  what are you arguing with them about   he asked </s>
<s> a man in the crowd answered   teacher  i brought you my son  who is possessed by a spirit that has robbed him of speech </s>
<s> whenever it seizes him  it throws him to the ground  he foams at the mouth  gnashes his teeth and becomes rigid  i asked your disciples to drive out the spirit  but they could not  </s>
<s>  you unbelieving generation   jesus replied   how long shall i stay with you  how long shall i put up with you  bring the boy to me  </s>
<s> so they brought him  when the spirit saw jesus  it immediately threw the boy into a convulsion  he fell to the ground and rolled around  foaming at the mouth </s>
<s> jesus asked the boys father   how long has he been like this    from childhood   he answered </s>
<s>  it has often thrown him into fire or water to kill him  but if you can do anything  take pity on us and help us  </s>
<s>   if you can    said jesus   everything is possible for one who believes  </s>
<s> immediately the boys father exclaimed   i do believe  help me overcome my unbelief  </s>
<s> when jesus saw that a crowd was running to the scene  he rebuked the impure spirit   you deaf and mute spirit   he said   i command you  come out of him and never enter him again  </s>
<s> the spirit shrieked  convulsed him violently and came out  the boy looked so much like a corpse that many said   hes dead  </s>
<s> but jesus took him by the hand and lifted him to his feet  and he stood up </s>
<s> after jesus had gone indoors  his disciples asked him privately   why couldnt we drive it out  </s>
<s> he replied   this kind can come out only by prayer  </s>
<s> they left that place and passed through galilee  jesus did not want anyone to know where they were </s>
<s> because he was teaching his disciples  he said to them   the son of man is going to be delivered into the hands of men  they will kill him  and after three days he will rise  </s>
<s> but they did not understand what he meant and were afraid to ask him about it </s>
<s> they came to capernaum  when he was in the house  he asked them   what were you arguing about on the road  </s>
<s> but they kept quiet because on the way they had argued about who was the greatest </s>
<s> sitting down  jesus called the twelve and said   anyone who wants to be first must be the very last  and the servant of all  </s>
<s> he took a little child whom he placed among them  taking the child in his arms  he said to them </s>
<s>  whoever welcomes one of these little children in my name welcomes me  and whoever welcomes me does not welcome me but the one who sent me  </s>
<s>  teacher   said john   we saw someone driving out demons in your name and we told him to stop  because he was not one of us  </s>
<s>  do not stop him   jesus said   for no one who does a miracle in my name can in the next moment say anything bad about me </s>
<s> for whoever is not against us is for us </s>
<s> truly i tell you  anyone who gives you a cup of water in my name because you belong to the messiah will certainly not lose their reward </s>
<s>  if anyone causes one of these little ones  those who believe in me  to stumble  it would be better for them if a large millstone were hung round their neck and they were thrown into the sea </s>
<s> if your hand causes you to stumble  cut it off  it is better for you to enter life maimed than with two hands to go into hell  where the fire never goes out  </s>
<s> </s>
<s> and if your foot causes you to stumble  cut it off  it is better for you to enter life crippled than to have two feet and be thrown into hell  </s>
<s> </s>
<s> and if your eye causes you to stumble  pluck it out  it is better for you to enter the kingdom of god with one eye than to have two eyes and be thrown into hell </s>
<s> where   the worms that eat them do not die  and the fire is not quenched  </s>
<s>  salt is good  but if it loses its saltiness  how can you make it salty again  have salt among yourselves  and be at peace with each other  </s>
<s> jesus then left that place and went into the region of judea and across the jordan  again crowds of people came to him  and as was his custom  he taught them </s>
<s> some pharisees came and tested him by asking   is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife  </s>
<s>  what did moses command you   he replied </s>
<s> they said   moses permitted a man to write a certificate of divorce and send her away  </s>
<s>  it was because your hearts were hard that moses wrote you this law   jesus replied </s>
<s>  but at the beginning of creation god  made them male and female  </s>
<s>  for this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife </s>
<s> and the two will become one flesh   so they are no longer two  but one flesh </s>
<s> therefore what god has joined together  let no one separate  </s>
<s> when they were in the house again  the disciples asked jesus about this </s>
<s> he answered   anyone who divorces his wife and marries another woman commits adultery against her </s>
<s> and if she divorces her husband and marries another man  she commits adultery  </s>
<s> people were bringing little children to jesus for him to place his hands on them  but the disciples rebuked them </s>
<s> when jesus saw this  he was indignant  he said to them   let the little children come to me  and do not hinder them  for the kingdom of god belongs to such as these </s>
<s> truly i tell you  anyone who will not receive the kingdom of god like a little child will never enter it  </s>
<s> and he took the children in his arms  placed his hands on them and blessed them </s>
<s> as jesus started on his way  a man ran up to him and fell on his knees before him   good teacher   he asked   what must i do to inherit eternal life  </s>
<s>  why do you call me good   jesus answered   no one is good  except god alone </s>
<s> you know the commandments   you shall not murder  you shall not commit adultery  you shall not steal  you shall not give false testimony  you shall not defraud  honour your father and mother   </s>
<s>  teacher   he declared   all these i have kept since i was a boy  </s>
<s> jesus looked at him and loved him   one thing you lack   he said   go  sell everything you have and give to the poor  and you will have treasure in heaven  then come  follow me  </s>
<s> at this the mans face fell  he went away sad  because he had great wealth </s>
<s> jesus looked round and said to his disciples   how hard it is for the rich to enter the kingdom of god  </s>
<s> the disciples were amazed at his words  but jesus said again   children  how hard it is to enter the kingdom of god </s>
<s> it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of god  </s>
<s> the disciples were even more amazed  and said to each other   who then can be saved  </s>
<s> jesus looked at them and said   with man this is impossible  but not with god  all things are possible with god  </s>
<s> then peter spoke up   we have left everything to follow you  </s>
<s>  truly i tell you   jesus replied   no one who has left home or brothers or sisters or mother or father or children or fields for me and the gospel</s>
<s> will fail to receive a hundred times as much in this present age  homes  brothers  sisters  mothers  children and fields  along with persecutions  and in the age to come eternal life </s>
<s> but many who are first will be last  and the last first  </s>
<s> they were on their way up to jerusalem  with jesus leading the way  and the disciples were astonished  while those who followed were afraid  again he took the twelve aside and told them what was going to happen to him </s>
<s>  we are going up to jerusalem   he said   and the son of man will be delivered over to the chief priests and the teachers of the law  they will condemn him to death and will hand him over to the gentiles </s>
<s> who will mock him and spit on him  flog him and kill him  three days later he will rise  </s>
<s> then james and john  the sons of zebedee  came to him   teacher   they said   we want you to do for us whatever we ask  </s>
<s>  what do you want me to do for you   he asked </s>
<s> they replied   let one of us sit at your right and the other at your left in your glory  </s>
<s>  you dont know what you are asking   jesus said   can you drink the cup i drink or be baptised with the baptism i am baptised with  </s>
<s>  we can   they answered  jesus said to them   you will drink the cup i drink and be baptised with the baptism i am baptised with </s>
<s> but to sit at my right or left is not for me to grant  these places belong to those for whom they have been prepared  </s>
<s> when the ten heard about this  they became indignant with james and john </s>
<s> jesus called them together and said   you know that those who are regarded as rulers of the gentiles lord it over them  and their high officials exercise authority over them </s>
<s> not so with you  instead  whoever wants to become great among you must be your servant </s>
<s> and whoever wants to be first must be slave of all </s>
<s> for even the son of man did not come to be served  but to serve  and to give his life as a ransom for many  </s>
<s> then they came to jericho  as jesus and his disciples  together with a large crowd  were leaving the city  a blind man  bartimaeus  which means  son of timaeus   was sitting by the roadside begging </s>
<s> when he heard that it was jesus of nazareth  he began to shout   jesus  son of david  have mercy on me  </s>
<s> many rebuked him and told him to be quiet  but he shouted all the more   son of david  have mercy on me  </s>
<s> jesus stopped and said   call him   so they called to the blind man   cheer up  on your feet  hes calling you  </s>
<s> throwing his cloak aside  he jumped to his feet and came to jesus </s>
<s>  what do you want me to do for you   jesus asked him  the blind man said   rabbi  i want to see  </s>
<s>  go   said jesus   your faith has healed you   immediately he received his sight and followed jesus along the road </s>
<s> as they approached jerusalem and came to bethphage and bethany at the mount of olives  jesus sent two of his disciples </s>
<s> saying to them   go to the village ahead of you  and just as you enter it  you will find a colt tied there  which no one has ever ridden  untie it and bring it here </s>
<s> if anyone asks you   why are you doing this   say   the lord needs it and will send it back here shortly   </s>
<s> they went and found a colt outside in the street  tied at a doorway  as they untied it </s>
<s> some people standing there asked   what are you doing  untying that colt  </s>
<s> they answered as jesus had told them to  and the people let them go </s>
<s> when they brought the colt to jesus and threw their cloaks over it  he sat on it </s>
<s> many people spread their cloaks on the road  while others spread branches they had cut in the fields </s>
<s> those who went ahead and those who followed shouted   hosanna    blessed is he who comes in the name of the lord  </s>
<s>  blessed is the coming kingdom of our father david    hosanna in the highest heaven  </s>
<s> jesus entered jerusalem and went into the temple courts  he looked around at everything  but since it was already late  he went out to bethany with the twelve </s>
<s> the next day as they were leaving bethany  jesus was hungry </s>
<s> seeing in the distance a figtree in leaf  he went to find out if it had any fruit  when he reached it  he found nothing but leaves  because it was not the season for figs </s>
<s> then he said to the tree   may no one ever eat fruit from you again   and his disciples heard him say it </s>
<s> on reaching jerusalem  jesus entered the temple courts and began driving out those who were buying and selling there  he overturned the tables of the moneychangers and the benches of those selling doves </s>
<s> and would not allow anyone to carry merchandise through the temple courts </s>
<s> and as he taught them  he said   is it not written   my house will be called a house of prayer for all nations   but you have made it  a den of robbers   </s>
<s> the chief priests and the teachers of the law heard this and began looking for a way to kill him  for they feared him  because the whole crowd was amazed at his teaching </s>
<s> when evening came  jesus and his disciples went out of the city </s>
<s> in the morning  as they went along  they saw the figtree withered from the roots </s>
<s> peter remembered and said to jesus   rabbi  look  the figtree you cursed has withered  </s>
<s>  have faith in god   jesus answered </s>
<s>  truly i tell you  if anyone says to this mountain   go  throw yourself into the sea   and does not doubt in their heart but believes that what they say will happen  it will be done for them </s>
<s> therefore i tell you  whatever you ask for in prayer  believe that you have received it  and it will be yours </s>
<s> and when you stand praying  if you hold anything against anyone  forgive them  so that your father in heaven may forgive you your sins   </s>
<s> </s>
<s> they arrived again in jerusalem  and while jesus was walking in the temple courts  the chief priests  the teachers of the law and the elders came to him </s>
<s>  by what authority are you doing these things   they asked   and who gave you authority to do this  </s>
<s> jesus replied   i will ask you one question  answer me  and i will tell you by what authority i am doing these things </s>
<s> johns baptism  was it from heaven  or of human origin  tell me  </s>
<s> they discussed it among themselves and said   if we say   from heaven   he will ask   then why didnt you believe him  </s>
<s> but if we say   of human origin     they feared the people  for everyone held that john really was a prophet  </s>
<s> so they answered jesus   we dont know   jesus said   neither will i tell you by what authority i am doing these things  </s>
<s> jesus then began to speak to them in parables   a man planted a vineyard  he put a wall round it  dug a pit for the winepress and built a watchtower  then he rented the vineyard to some farmers and moved to another place </s>
<s> at harvest time he sent a servant to the tenants to collect from them some of the fruit of the vineyard </s>
<s> but they seized him  beat him and sent him away emptyhanded </s>
<s> then he sent another servant to them  they struck this man on the head and treated him shamefully </s>
<s> he sent still another  and that one they killed  he sent many others  some of them they beat  others they killed </s>
<s>  he had one left to send  a son  whom he loved  he sent him last of all  saying   they will respect my son  </s>
<s>  but the tenants said to one another   this is the heir  come  lets kill him  and the inheritance will be ours  </s>
<s> so they took him and killed him  and threw him out of the vineyard </s>
<s>  what then will the owner of the vineyard do  he will come and kill those tenants and give the vineyard to others </s>
<s> havent you read this passage of scripture    the stone the builders rejected has become the cornerstone </s>
<s> the lord has done this  and it is marvellous in our eyes   </s>
<s> then the chief priests  the teachers of the law and the elders looked for a way to arrest him because they knew he had spoken the parable against them  but they were afraid of the crowd  so they left him and went away </s>
<s> later they sent some of the pharisees and herodians to jesus to catch him in his words </s>
<s> they came to him and said   teacher  we know that you are a man of integrity  you arent swayed by others  because you pay no attention to who they are  but you teach the way of god in accordance with the truth  is it right to pay the polltax to caesar or not </s>
<s> should we pay or shouldnt we   but jesus knew their hypocrisy   why are you trying to trap me   he asked   bring me a denarius and let me look at it  </s>
<s> they brought the coin  and he asked them   whose image is this  and whose inscription    caesars   they replied </s>
<s> then jesus said to them   give back to caesar what is caesars and to god what is gods   and they were amazed at him </s>
<s> then the sadducees  who say there is no resurrection  came to him with a question </s>
<s>  teacher   they said   moses wrote for us that if a mans brother dies and leaves a wife but no children  the man must marry the widow and raise up offspring for his brother </s>
<s> now there were seven brothers  the first one married and died without leaving any children </s>
<s> the second one married the widow  but he also died  leaving no child  it was the same with the third </s>
<s> in fact  none of the seven left any children  last of all  the woman died too </s>
<s> at the resurrection whose wife will she be  since the seven were married to her  </s>
<s> jesus replied   are you not in error because you do not know the scriptures or the power of god </s>
<s> when the dead rise  they will neither marry nor be given in marriage  they will be like the angels in heaven </s>
<s> now about the dead rising  have you not read in the book of moses  in the account of the burning bush  how god said to him   i am the god of abraham  the god of isaac  and the god of jacob  </s>
<s> he is not the god of the dead  but of the living  you are badly mistaken  </s>
<s> one of the teachers of the law came and heard them debating  noticing that jesus had given them a good answer  he asked him   of all the commandments  which is the most important  </s>
<s>  the most important one   answered jesus   is this   hear  o israel  the lord our god  the lord is one </s>
<s> love the lord your god with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind and with all your strength  </s>
<s> the second is this   love your neighbour as yourself   there is no commandment greater than these  </s>
<s>  well said  teacher   the man replied   you are right in saying that god is one and there is no other but him </s>
<s> to love him with all your heart  with all your understanding and with all your strength  and to love your neighbour as yourself is more important than all burnt offerings and sacrifices  </s>
<s> when jesus saw that he had answered wisely  he said to him   you are not far from the kingdom of god   and from then on no one dared ask him any more questions </s>
<s> while jesus was teaching in the temple courts  he asked   why do the teachers of the law say that the messiah is the son of david </s>
<s> david himself  speaking by the holy spirit  declared    the lord said to my lord   sit at my right hand until i put your enemies under your feet    the large crowd listened to him with delight </s>
<s> as he taught  jesus said   watch out for the teachers of the law  they like to walk around in flowing robes and be greeted with respect in the marketplaces </s>
<s> and have the most important seats in the synagogues and the places of honour at banquets </s>
<s> they devour widows houses and for a show make lengthy prayers  these men will be punished most severely  </s>
<s> jesus sat down opposite the place where the offerings were put and watched the crowd putting their money into the temple treasury  many rich people threw in large amounts </s>
<s> but a poor widow came and put in two very small copper coins  worth only a few pence </s>
<s> calling his disciples to him  jesus said   truly i tell you  this poor widow has put more into the treasury than all the others </s>
<s> they all gave out of their wealth  but she  out of her poverty  put in everything  all she had to live on  </s>
<s> as jesus was leaving the temple  one of his disciples said to him   look  teacher  what massive stones  what magnificent buildings  </s>
<s>  do you see all these great buildings   replied jesus   not one stone here will be left on another  every one will be thrown down  </s>
<s> as jesus was sitting on the mount of olives opposite the temple  peter  james  john and andrew asked him privately </s>
<s>  tell us  when will these things happen  and what will be the sign that they are all about to be fulfilled  </s>
<s> jesus said to them   watch out that no one deceives you </s>
<s> many will come in my name  claiming   i am he   and will deceive many </s>
<s> when you hear of wars and rumours of wars  do not be alarmed  such things must happen  but the end is still to come </s>
<s> nation will rise against nation  and kingdom against kingdom  there will be earthquakes in various places  and famines  these are the beginning of birthpains </s>
<s>  you must be on your guard  you will be handed over to the local councils and flogged in the synagogues  on account of me you will stand before governors and kings as witnesses to them </s>
<s> and the gospel must first be preached to all nations </s>
<s> whenever you are arrested and brought to trial  do not worry beforehand about what to say  just say whatever is given you at the time  for it is not you speaking  but the holy spirit </s>
<s>  brother will betray brother to death  and a father his child  children will rebel against their parents and have them put to death </s>
<s> everyone will hate you because of me  but the one who stands firm to the end will be saved </s>
<s>  when you see  the abomination that causes desolation  standing where it does not belong  let the reader understand  then let those who are in judea flee to the mountains </s>
<s> let no one on the housetop go down or enter the house to take anything out </s>
<s> let no one in the field go back to get their cloak </s>
<s> how dreadful it will be in those days for pregnant women and nursing mothers </s>
<s> pray that this will not take place in winter </s>
<s> because those will be days of distress unequalled from the beginning  when god created the world  until now  and never to be equalled again </s>
<s>  if the lord had not cut short those days  no one would survive  but for the sake of the elect  whom he has chosen  he has shortened them </s>
<s> at that time if anyone says to you   look  here is the messiah   or   look  there he is   do not believe it </s>
<s> for false messiahs and false prophets will appear and perform signs and wonders to deceive  if possible  even the elect </s>
<s> so be on your guard  i have told you everything in advance </s>
<s>  but in those days  following that distress    the sun will be darkened  and the moon will not give its light </s>
<s> the stars will fall from the sky  and the heavenly bodies will be shaken  </s>
<s>  at that time people will see the son of man coming in clouds with great power and glory </s>
<s> and he will send his angels and gather his elect from the four winds  from the ends of the earth to the ends of the heavens </s>
<s>  now learn this lesson from the figtree  as soon as its twigs get tender and its leaves come out  you know that summer is near </s>
<s> even so  when you see these things happening  you know that it is near  right at the door </s>
<s> truly i tell you  this generation will certainly not pass away until all these things have happened </s>
<s> heaven and earth will pass away  but my words will never pass away </s>
<s>  but about that day or hour no one knows  not even the angels in heaven  nor the son  but only the father </s>
<s> be on guard  be alert  you do not know when that time will come </s>
<s> its like a man going away  he leaves his house and puts his servants in charge  each with their assigned task  and tells the one at the door to keep watch </s>
<s>  therefore keep watch because you do not know when the owner of the house will come back  whether in the evening  or at midnight  or when the cock crows  or at dawn </s>
<s> if he comes suddenly  do not let him find you sleeping </s>
<s> what i say to you  i say to everyone   watch   </s>
<s> now the passover and the festival of unleavened bread were only two days away  and the chief priests and the teachers of the law were scheming to arrest jesus secretly and kill him </s>
<s>  but not during the festival   they said   or the people may riot  </s>
<s> while he was in bethany  reclining at the table in the home of simon the leper  a woman came with an alabaster jar of very expensive perfume  made of pure nard  she broke the jar and poured the perfume on his head </s>
<s> some of those present were saying indignantly to one another   why this waste of perfume </s>
<s> it could have been sold for more than a years wages and the money given to the poor   and they rebuked her harshly </s>
<s>  leave her alone   said jesus   why are you bothering her  she has done a beautiful thing to me </s>
<s> the poor you will always have with you  and you can help them any time you want  but you will not always have me </s>
<s> she did what she could  she poured perfume on my body beforehand to prepare for my burial </s>
<s> truly i tell you  wherever the gospel is preached throughout the world  what she has done will also be told  in memory of her  </s>
<s> then judas iscariot  one of the twelve  went to the chief priests to betray jesus to them </s>
<s> they were delighted to hear this and promised to give him money  so he watched for an opportunity to hand him over </s>
<s> on the first day of the festival of unleavened bread  when it was customary to sacrifice the passover lamb  jesus disciples asked him   where do you want us to go and make preparations for you to eat the passover  </s>
<s> so he sent two of his disciples  telling them   go into the city  and a man carrying a jar of water will meet you  follow him </s>
<s> say to the owner of the house he enters   the teacher asks  where is my guest room  where i may eat the passover with my disciples  </s>
<s> he will show you a large room upstairs  furnished and ready  make preparations for us there  </s>
<s> the disciples left  went into the city and found things just as jesus had told them  so they prepared the passover </s>
<s> when evening came  jesus arrived with the twelve </s>
<s> while they were reclining at the table eating  he said   truly i tell you  one of you will betray me  one who is eating with me  </s>
<s> they were saddened  and one by one they said to him   surely you dont mean me  </s>
<s>  it is one of the twelve   he replied   one who dips bread into the bowl with me </s>
<s> the son of man will go just as it is written about him  but woe to that man who betrays the son of man  it would be better for him if he had not been born  </s>
<s> while they were eating  jesus took bread  and when he had given thanks  he broke it and gave it to his disciples  saying   take it  this is my body  </s>
<s> then he took a cup  and when he had given thanks  he gave it to them  and they all drank from it </s>
<s>  this is my blood of the covenant  which is poured out for many   he said to them </s>
<s>  truly i tell you  i will not drink again from the fruit of the vine until that day when i drink it new in the kingdom of god  </s>
<s> when they had sung a hymn  they went out to the mount of olives </s>
<s>  you will all fall away   jesus told them   for it is written    i will strike the shepherd  and the sheep will be scattered  </s>
<s> peter declared   even if all fall away  i will not  </s>
<s>  truly i tell you   jesus answered   today  yes  tonight  before the cock crows twice you yourself will disown me three times  </s>
<s> but peter insisted emphatically   even if i have to die with you  i will never disown you   and all the others said the same </s>
<s> they went to a place called gethsemane  and jesus said to his disciples   sit here while i pray  </s>
<s> he took peter  james and john along with him  and he began to be deeply distressed and troubled </s>
<s>  my soul is overwhelmed with sorrow to the point of death   he said to them   stay here and keep watch  </s>
<s> going a little farther  he fell to the ground and prayed that if possible the hour might pass from him </s>
<s>  abba  father   he said   everything is possible for you  take this cup from me  yet not what i will  but what you will  </s>
<s> then he returned to his disciples and found them sleeping   simon   he said to peter   are you asleep  couldnt you keep watch for one hour </s>
<s> watch and pray so that you will not fall into temptation  the spirit is willing  but the flesh is weak  </s>
<s> once more he went away and prayed the same thing </s>
<s> when he came back  he again found them sleeping  because their eyes were heavy  they did not know what to say to him </s>
<s> returning the third time  he said to them   are you still sleeping and resting  enough  the hour has come  look  the son of man is delivered into the hands of sinners </s>
<s> rise  let us go  here comes my betrayer  </s>
<s> just as he was speaking  judas  one of the twelve  appeared  with him was a crowd armed with swords and clubs  sent from the chief priests  the teachers of the law  and the elders </s>
<s> now the betrayer had arranged a signal with them   the one i kiss is the man  arrest him and lead him away under guard  </s>
<s> going at once to jesus  judas said   rabbi   and kissed him </s>
<s> the men seized jesus and arrested him </s>
<s> then one of those standing near drew his sword and struck the servant of the high priest  cutting off his ear </s>
<s>  am i leading a rebellion   said jesus   that you have come out with swords and clubs to capture me </s>
<s> every day i was with you  teaching in the temple courts  and you did not arrest me  but the scriptures must be fulfilled  </s>
<s> then everyone deserted him and fled </s>
<s> a young man  wearing nothing but a linen garment  was following jesus  when they seized him </s>
<s> he fled naked  leaving his garment behind </s>
<s> they took jesus to the high priest  and all the chief priests  the elders and the teachers of the law came together </s>
<s> peter followed him at a distance  right into the courtyard of the high priest  there he sat with the guards and warmed himself at the fire </s>
<s> the chief priests and the whole sanhedrin were looking for evidence against jesus so that they could put him to death  but they did not find any </s>
<s> many testified falsely against him  but their statements did not agree </s>
<s> then some stood up and gave this false testimony against him </s>
<s>  we heard him say   i will destroy this temple made with human hands and in three days will build another  not made with hands   </s>
<s> yet even then their testimony did not agree </s>
<s> then the high priest stood up before them and asked jesus   are you not going to answer  what is this testimony that these men are bringing against you  </s>
<s> but jesus remained silent and gave no answer  again the high priest asked him   are you the messiah  the son of the blessed one  </s>
<s>  i am   said jesus   and you will see the son of man sitting at the right hand of the mighty one and coming on the clouds of heaven  </s>
<s> the high priest tore his clothes   why do we need any more witnesses   he asked </s>
<s>  you have heard the blasphemy  what do you think   they all condemned him as worthy of death </s>
<s> then some began to spit at him  they blindfolded him  struck him with their fists  and said   prophesy   and the guards took him and beat him </s>

<s> again he denied it  after a little while  those standing near said to peter   surely you are one of them  for you are a galilean  </s>
<s> he began to call down curses  and he swore to them   i dont know this man youre talking about  </s>
<s> immediately the cock crowed the second time  then peter remembered the word jesus had spoken to him   before the cock crows twice you will disown me three times   and he broke down and wept </s>
<s> very early in the morning  the chief priests  with the elders  the teachers of the law and the whole sanhedrin  made their plans  so they bound jesus  led him away and handed him over to pilate </s>
<s>  are you the king of the jews   asked pilate   you have said so   jesus replied </s>
<s> the chief priests accused him of many things </s>
<s> so again pilate asked him   arent you going to answer  see how many things they are accusing you of  </s>
<s> but jesus still made no reply  and pilate was amazed </s>
<s> now it was the custom at the festival to release a prisoner whom the people requested </s>
<s> a man called barabbas was in prison with the rebels who had committed murder in the uprising </s>
<s> the crowd came up and asked pilate to do for them what he usually did </s>
<s>  do you want me to release to you the king of the jews   asked pilate </s>
<s> knowing it was out of selfinterest that the chief priests had handed jesus over to him </s>
<s> but the chief priests stirred up the crowd to get pilate to release barabbas instead </s>
<s>  what shall i do  then  with the one you call the king of the jews   pilate asked them </s>
<s>  crucify him   they shouted </s>
<s>  why  what crime has he committed   asked pilate  but they shouted all the louder   crucify him  </s>
<s> wanting to satisfy the crowd  pilate released barabbas to them  he had jesus flogged  and handed him over to be crucified </s>
<s> the soldiers led jesus away into the palace  that is  the praetorium  and called together the whole company of soldiers </s>
<s> they put a purple robe on him  then twisted together a crown of thorns and set it on him </s>
<s> and they began to call out to him   hail  king of the jews  </s>
<s> again and again they struck him on the head with a staff and spat on him  falling on their knees  they paid homage to him </s>
<s> and when they had mocked him  they took off the purple robe and put his own clothes on him  then they led him out to crucify him </s>
<s> a certain man from cyrene  simon  the father of alexander and rufus  was passing by on his way in from the country  and they forced him to carry the cross </s>
<s> they brought jesus to the place called golgotha  which means  the place of the skull  </s>
<s> then they offered him wine mixed with myrrh  but he did not take it </s>
<s> and they crucified him  dividing up his clothes  they cast lots to see what each would get </s>
<s> it was nine in the morning when they crucified him </s>
<s> the written notice of the charge against him read  the king of the jews </s>
<s> they crucified two rebels with him  one on his right and one on his left  </s>
<s> </s>
<s> those who passed by hurled insults at him  shaking their heads and saying   so  you who are going to destroy the temple and build it in three days </s>
<s> come down from the cross and save yourself  </s>
<s> in the same way the chief priests and the teachers of the law mocked him among themselves   he saved others   they said   but he cant save himself </s>
<s> let this messiah  this king of israel  come down now from the cross  that we may see and believe   those crucified with him also heaped insults on him </s>
<s> at noon  darkness came over the whole land until three in the afternoon </s>
<s> and at three in the afternoon jesus cried out in a loud voice   eloi  eloi  lema sabachthani    which means  my god  my god  why have you forsaken me    </s>
<s> when some of those standing near heard this  they said   listen  hes calling elijah  </s>
<s> someone ran  filled a sponge with wine vinegar  put it on a staff  and offered it to jesus to drink   now leave him alone  lets see if elijah comes to take him down   he said </s>
<s> with a loud cry  jesus breathed his last </s>
<s> the curtain of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom </s>
<s> and when the centurion  who stood there in front of jesus  saw how he died  he said   surely this man was the son of god  </s>
<s> some women were watching from a distance  among them were mary magdalene  mary the mother of james the younger and of joseph  and salome </s>

<s> when he learned from the centurion that it was so  he gave the body to joseph </s>

<s> very early on the first day of the week  just after sunrise  they were on their way to the tomb</s>
<s> and they asked each other   who will roll the stone away from the entrance of the tomb  </s>
<s> but when they looked up  they saw that the stone  which was very large  had been rolled away </s>
<s> as they entered the tomb  they saw a young man dressed in a white robe sitting on the right side  and they were alarmed </s>
<s>  dont be alarmed   he said   you are looking for jesus the nazarene  who was crucified  he has risen  he is not here  see the place where they laid him </s>
<s> but go  tell his disciples and peter   he is going ahead of you into galilee  there you will see him  just as he told you   </s>
<s> trembling and bewildered  the women went out and fled from the tomb  they said nothing to anyone  because they were afraid </s>
<s> when jesus rose early on the first day of the week  he appeared first to mary magdalene  out of whom he had driven seven demons </s>
<s> she went and told those who had been with him and who were mourning and weeping </s>
<s> when they heard that jesus was alive and that she had seen him  they did not believe it </s>
<s> afterwards jesus appeared in a different form to two of them while they were walking in the country </s>
<s> these returned and reported it to the rest  but they did not believe them either </s>
<s> later jesus appeared to the eleven as they were eating  he rebuked them for their lack of faith and their stubborn refusal to believe those who had seen him after he had risen </s>
<s> he said to them   go into all the world and preach the gospel to all creation </s>
<s> whoever believes and is baptised will be saved  but whoever does not believe will be condemned </s>
<s> and these signs will accompany those who believe  in my name they will drive out demons  they will speak in new tongues </s>
<s> they will pick up snakes with their hands  and when they drink deadly poison  it will not hurt them at all  they will place their hands on people who are ill  and they will get well  </s>
<s> after the lord jesus had spoken to them  he was taken up into heaven and he sat at the right hand of god </s>
<s> then the disciples went out and preached everywhere  and the lord worked with them and confirmed his word by the signs that accompanied it </s>
<s> many have undertaken to draw up an account of the things that have been fulfilled among us </s>
<s> just as they were handed down to us by those who from the first were eye witnesses and servants of the word </s>
<s> with this in mind  since i myself have carefully investigated everything from the beginning  i too decided to write an orderly account for you  most excellent theophilus </s>
<s> so that you may know the certainty of the things you have been taught </s>
<s> in the time of herod king of judea there was a priest named zechariah  who belonged to the priestly division of abijah  his wife elizabeth was also a descendant of aaron </s>
<s> both of them were righteous in the sight of god  observing all the lords commands and decrees blamelessly </s>
<s> but they were childless because elizabeth was not able to conceive  and they were both very old </s>
<s> once when zechariahs division was on duty and he was serving as priest before god </s>
<s> he was chosen by lot  according to the custom of the priesthood  to go into the temple of the lord and burn incense </s>
<s> and when the time for the burning of incense came  all the assembled worshippers were praying outside </s>
<s> then an angel of the lord appeared to him  standing at the right side of the altar of incense </s>
<s> when zechariah saw him  he was startled and was gripped with fear </s>
<s> but the angel said to him   do not be afraid  zechariah  your prayer has been heard  your wife elizabeth will bear you a son  and you are to call him john </s>
<s> he will be a joy and delight to you  and many will rejoice because of his birth </s>
<s> for he will be great in the sight of the lord  he is never to take wine or other fermented drink  and he will be filled with the holy spirit even before he is born </s>
<s> he will bring back many of the people of israel to the lord their god </s>
<s> and he will go on before the lord  in the spirit and power of elijah  to turn the hearts of the parents to their children and the disobedient to the wisdom of the righteous  to make ready a people prepared for the lord  </s>
<s> zechariah asked the angel   how can i be sure of this  i am an old man and my wife is well on in years  </s>
<s> the angel said to him   i am gabriel  i stand in the presence of god  and i have been sent to speak to you and to tell you this good news </s>
<s> and now you will be silent and not able to speak until the day this happens  because you did not believe my words  which will come true at their appointed time  </s>
<s> meanwhile  the people were waiting for zechariah and wondering why he stayed so long in the temple </s>
<s> when he came out  he could not speak to them  they realised he had seen a vision in the temple  for he kept making signs to them but remained unable to speak </s>
<s> when his time of service was completed  he returned home </s>
<s> after this his wife elizabeth became pregnant and for five months remained in seclusion </s>
<s>  the lord has done this for me   she said   in these days he has shown his favour and taken away my disgrace among the people  </s>
<s> in the sixth month of elizabeths pregnancy  god sent the angel gabriel to nazareth  a town in galilee </s>
<s> to a virgin pledged to be married to a man named joseph  a descendant of david  the virgins name was mary </s>
<s> the angel went to her and said   greetings  you who are highly favoured  the lord is with you  </s>
<s> mary was greatly troubled at his words and wondered what kind of greeting this might be </s>
<s> but the angel said to her   do not be afraid  mary  you have found favour with god </s>
<s> you will conceive and give birth to a son  and you are to call him jesus </s>
<s> he will be great and will be called the son of the most high  the lord god will give him the throne of his father david </s>
<s> and he will reign over jacobs descendants for ever  his kingdom will never end  </s>
<s>  how will this be   mary asked the angel   since i am a virgin  </s>
<s> the angel answered   the holy spirit will come on you  and the power of the most high will overshadow you  so the holy one to be born will be called the son of god </s>
<s> even elizabeth your relative is going to have a child in her old age  and she who was said to be unable to conceive is in her sixth month </s>
<s> for no word from god will ever fail  </s>
<s>  i am the lords servant   mary answered   may your word to me be fulfilled   then the angel left her </s>
<s> at that time mary got ready and hurried to a town in the hill country of judea </s>
<s> where she entered zechariahs home and greeted elizabeth </s>
<s> when elizabeth heard marys greeting  the baby leaped in her womb  and elizabeth was filled with the holy spirit </s>
<s> in a loud voice she exclaimed   blessed are you among women  and blessed is the child you will bear </s>
<s> but why am i so favoured  that the mother of my lord should come to me </s>
<s> as soon as the sound of your greeting reached my ears  the baby in my womb leaped for joy </s>
<s> blessed is she who has believed that the lord would fulfil his promises to her  </s>
<s> and mary said </s>
<s> mary stayed with elizabeth for about three months and then returned home </s>
<s> when it was time for elizabeth to have her baby  she gave birth to a son </s>
<s> her neighbours and relatives heard that the lord had shown her great mercy  and they shared her joy </s>
<s> on the eighth day they came to circumcise the child  and they were going to name him after his father zechariah </s>
<s> but his mother spoke up and said   no  he is to be called john  </s>
<s> they said to her   there is no one among your relatives who has that name  </s>
<s> then they made signs to his father  to find out what he would like to name the child </s>
<s> he asked for a writing tablet  and to everyones astonishment he wrote   his name is john  </s>
<s> immediately his mouth was opened and his tongue set free  and he began to speak  praising god </s>
<s> all the neighbours were filled with awe  and throughout the hill country of judea people were talking about all these things </s>
<s> everyone who heard this wondered about it  asking   what then is this child going to be   for the lords hand was with him </s>
<s> his father zechariah was filled with the holy spirit and prophesied </s>
<s> and the child grew and became strong in spirit  and he lived in the wilderness until he appeared publicly to israel </s>
<s> in those days caesar augustus issued a decree that a census should be taken of the entire roman world </s>
<s>  this was the first census that took place while quirinius was governor of syria  </s>
<s> and everyone went to their own town to register </s>
<s> so joseph also went up from the town of nazareth in galilee to judea  to bethlehem the town of david  because he belonged to the house and line of david </s>
<s> he went there to register with mary  who was pledged to be married to him and was expecting a child </s>
<s> while they were there  the time came for the baby to be born </s>
<s> and she gave birth to her firstborn  a son  she wrapped him in cloths and placed him in a manger  because there was no guest room available for them </s>
<s> and there were shepherds living out in the fields near by  keeping watch over their flocks at night </s>
<s> an angel of the lord appeared to them  and the glory of the lord shone around them  and they were terrified </s>
<s> but the angel said to them   do not be afraid  i bring you good news that will cause great joy for all the people </s>
<s> today in the town of david a saviour has been born to you  he is the messiah  the lord </s>
<s> this will be a sign to you  you will find a baby wrapped in cloths and lying in a manger  </s>
<s> suddenly a great company of the heavenly host appeared with the angel  praising god and saying </s>
<s>  glory to god in the highest heaven  and on earth peace to those on whom his favour rests  </s>
<s> when the angels had left them and gone into heaven  the shepherds said to one another   lets go to bethlehem and see this thing that has happened  which the lord has told us about  </s>
<s> so they hurried off and found mary and joseph  and the baby  who was lying in the manger </s>
<s> when they had seen him  they spread the word concerning what had been told them about this child </s>
<s> and all who heard it were amazed at what the shepherds said to them </s>
<s> but mary treasured up all these things and pondered them in her heart </s>
<s> the shepherds returned  glorifying and praising god for all the things they had heard and seen  which were just as they had been told </s>
<s> on the eighth day  when it was time to circumcise the child  he was named jesus  the name the angel had given him before he was conceived </s>
<s> when the time came for the purification rites required by the law of moses  joseph and mary took him to jerusalem to present him to the lord</s>
<s>  as it is written in the law of the lord   every firstborn male is to be consecrated to the lord  </s>
<s> and to offer a sacrifice in keeping with what is said in the law of the lord   a pair of doves or two young pigeons </s>
<s> now there was a man in jerusalem called simeon  who was righteous and devout  he was waiting for the consolation of israel  and the holy spirit was on him </s>
<s> it had been revealed to him by the holy spirit that he would not die before he had seen the lords messiah </s>
<s> moved by the spirit  he went into the temple courts  when the parents brought in the child jesus to do for him what the custom of the law required </s>
<s> simeon took him in his arms and praised god  saying </s>
<s> the childs father and mother marvelled at what was said about him </s>
<s> then simeon blessed them and said to mary  his mother   this child is destined to cause the falling and rising of many in israel  and to be a sign that will be spoken against </s>
<s> so that the thoughts of many hearts will be revealed  and a sword will pierce your own soul too  </s>
<s> there was also a prophet  anna  the daughter of penuel  of the tribe of asher  she was very old  she had lived with her husband seven years after her marriage </s>
<s> and then was a widow until she was eightyfour  she never left the temple but worshipped night and day  fasting and praying </s>
<s> coming up to them at that very moment  she gave thanks to god and spoke about the child to all who were looking forward to the redemption of jerusalem </s>
<s> when joseph and mary had done everything required by the law of the lord  they returned to galilee to their own town of nazareth </s>
<s> and the child grew and became strong  he was filled with wisdom  and the grace of god was on him </s>
<s> every year jesus parents went to jerusalem for the festival of the passover </s>
<s> when he was twelve years old  they went up to the festival  according to the custom </s>
<s> after the festival was over  while his parents were returning home  the boy jesus stayed behind in jerusalem  but they were unaware of it </s>
<s> thinking he was in their company  they travelled on for a day  then they began looking for him among their relatives and friends </s>
<s> when they did not find him  they went back to jerusalem to look for him </s>
<s> after three days they found him in the temple courts  sitting among the teachers  listening to them and asking them questions </s>
<s> everyone who heard him was amazed at his understanding and his answers </s>
<s> when his parents saw him  they were astonished  his mother said to him   son  why have you treated us like this  your father and i have been anxiously searching for you  </s>
<s>  why were you searching for me   he asked   didnt you know i had to be in my fathers house  </s>
<s> but they did not understand what he was saying to them </s>
<s> then he went down to nazareth with them and was obedient to them  but his mother treasured all these things in her heart </s>
<s> and jesus grew in wisdom and stature  and in favour with god and man </s>
<s> in the fifteenth year of the reign of tiberius caesar  when pontius pilate was governor of judea  herod tetrarch of galilee  his brother philip tetrarch of iturea and traconitis  and lysanias tetrarch of abilene </s>
<s> during the highpriesthood of annas and caiaphas  the word of god came to john son of zechariah in the wilderness </s>
<s> he went into all the country around the jordan  preaching a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins </s>
<s> as it is written in the book of the words of isaiah the prophet   a voice of one calling in the wilderness   prepare the way for the lord  make straight paths for him </s>
<s> every valley shall be filled in  every mountain and hill made low  the crooked roads shall become straight  the rough ways smooth </s>
<s> and all people will see gods salvation   </s>
<s> john said to the crowds coming out to be baptised by him   you brood of vipers  who warned you to flee from the coming wrath </s>
<s> produce fruit in keeping with repentance  and do not begin to say to yourselves   we have abraham as our father   for i tell you that out of these stones god can raise up children for abraham </s>
<s> the axe has been laid to the root of the trees  and every tree that does not produce good fruit will be cut down and thrown into the fire  </s>
<s>  what should we do then   the crowd asked </s>
<s> john answered   anyone who has two shirts should share with the one who has none  and anyone who has food should do the same  </s>
<s> even tax collectors came to be baptised   teacher   they asked   what should we do  </s>
<s>  dont collect any more than you are required to   he told them </s>
<s> then some soldiers asked him   and what should we do   he replied   dont extort money and dont accuse people falsely  be content with your pay  </s>
<s> the people were waiting expectantly and were all wondering in their hearts if john might possibly be the messiah </s>
<s> john answered them all   i baptise you with water  but one who is more powerful than i will come  the straps of whose sandals i am not worthy to untie  he will baptise you with the holy spirit and fire </s>
<s> his winnowing fork is in his hand to clear his threshingfloor and to gather the wheat into his barn  but he will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire  </s>
<s> and with many other words john exhorted the people and proclaimed the good news to them </s>
<s> but when john rebuked herod the tetrarch because of his marriage to herodias  his brothers wife  and all the other evil things he had done </s>
<s> herod added this to them all  he locked john up in prison </s>
<s> when all the people were being baptised  jesus was baptised too  and as he was praying  heaven was opened</s>
<s> and the holy spirit descended on him in bodily form like a dove  and a voice came from heaven   you are my son  whom i love  with you i am well pleased  </s>
<s> now jesus himself was about thirty years old when he began his ministry  he was the son  so it was thought  of joseph </s>
<s> jesus  full of the holy spirit  left the jordan and was led by the spirit into the wilderness </s>
<s> where for forty days he was tempted by the devil  he ate nothing during those days  and at the end of them he was hungry </s>
<s> the devil said to him   if you are the son of god  tell this stone to become bread  </s>
<s> jesus answered   it is written   man shall not live on bread alone   </s>
<s> the devil led him up to a high place and showed him in an instant all the kingdoms of the world </s>
<s> and he said to him   i will give you all their authority and splendour  it has been given to me  and i can give it to anyone i want to </s>
<s> if you worship me  it will all be yours  </s>
<s> jesus answered   it is written   worship the lord your god and serve him only   </s>
<s> the devil led him to jerusalem and had him stand on the highest point of the temple   if you are the son of god   he said   throw yourself down from here </s>
<s> for it is written    he will command his angels concerning you to guard you carefully </s>
<s> they will lift you up in their hands  so that you will not strike your foot against a stone   </s>
<s> jesus answered   it is said   do not put the lord your god to the test   </s>
<s> when the devil had finished all this tempting  he left him until an opportune time </s>
<s> jesus returned to galilee in the power of the spirit  and news about him spread through the whole countryside </s>
<s> he was teaching in their synagogues  and everyone praised him </s>
<s> he went to nazareth  where he had been brought up  and on the sabbath day he went into the synagogue  as was his custom  he stood up to read </s>
<s> and the scroll of the prophet isaiah was handed to him  unrolling it  he found the place where it is written </s>
<s>  the spirit of the lord is on me  because he has anointed me to proclaim good news to the poor  he has sent me to proclaim freedom for the prisoners and recovery of sight for the blind  to set the oppressed free </s>
<s> to proclaim the year of the lords favour  </s>
<s> then he rolled up the scroll  gave it back to the attendant and sat down  the eyes of everyone in the synagogue were fastened on him </s>
<s> he began by saying to them   today this scripture is fulfilled in your hearing  </s>
<s> all spoke well of him and were amazed at the gracious words that came from his lips   isnt this josephs son   they asked </s>
<s> jesus said to them   surely you will quote this proverb to me   physician  heal yourself   and you will tell me   do here in your home town what we have heard that you did in capernaum   </s>
<s>  truly i tell you   he continued   no prophet is accepted in his home town </s>
<s> i assure you that there were many widows in israel in elijahs time  when the sky was shut for three and a half years and there was a severe famine throughout the land </s>
<s> yet elijah was not sent to any of them  but to a widow in zarephath in the region of sidon </s>
<s> and there were many in israel with leprosy in the time of elisha the prophet  yet not one of them was cleansed  only naaman the syrian  </s>
<s> all the people in the synagogue were furious when they heard this </s>
<s> they got up  drove him out of the town  and took him to the brow of the hill on which the town was built  in order to throw him off the cliff </s>
<s> but he walked right through the crowd and went on his way </s>
<s> then he went down to capernaum  a town in galilee  and on the sabbath he taught the people </s>
<s> they were amazed at his teaching  because his words had authority </s>
<s> in the synagogue there was a man possessed by a demon  an impure spirit  he cried out at the top of his voice </s>
<s>  go away  what do you want with us  jesus of nazareth  have you come to destroy us  i know who you are  the holy one of god  </s>
<s>  be quiet   jesus said sternly   come out of him   then the demon threw the man down before them all and came out without injuring him </s>
<s> all the people were amazed and said to each other   what words these are  with authority and power he gives orders to impure spirits and they come out  </s>
<s> and the news about him spread throughout the surrounding area </s>
<s> jesus left the synagogue and went to the home of simon  now simons motherinlaw was suffering from a high fever  and they asked jesus to help her </s>
<s> so he bent over her and rebuked the fever  and it left her  she got up at once and began to wait on them </s>
<s> at sunset  the people brought to jesus all who had various kinds of illness  and laying his hands on each one  he healed them </s>
<s> moreover  demons came out of many people  shouting   you are the son of god   but he rebuked them and would not allow them to speak  because they knew he was the messiah </s>
<s> at daybreak  jesus went out to a solitary place  the people were looking for him and when they came to where he was  they tried to keep him from leaving them </s>
<s> but he said   i must proclaim the good news of the kingdom of god to the other towns also  because that is why i was sent  </s>
<s> and he kept on preaching in the synagogues of judea </s>
<s> one day as jesus was standing by the lake of gennesaret  the people were crowding round him and listening to the word of god </s>
<s> he saw at the waters edge two boats  left there by the fishermen  who were washing their nets </s>
<s> he got into one of the boats  the one belonging to simon  and asked him to put out a little from the shore  then he sat down and taught the people from the boat </s>
<s> when he had finished speaking  he said to simon   put out into deep water  and let down the nets for a catch  </s>
<s> simon answered   master  weve worked hard all night and havent caught anything  but because you say so  i will let down the nets  </s>
<s> when they had done so  they caught such a large number of fish that their nets began to break </s>
<s> so they signalled to their partners in the other boat to come and help them  and they came and filled both boats so full that they began to sink </s>
<s> when simon peter saw this  he fell at jesus knees and said   go away from me  lord  i am a sinful man  </s>
<s> for he and all his companions were astonished at the catch of fish they had taken </s>
<s> and so were james and john  the sons of zebedee  simons partners  then jesus said to simon   dont be afraid  from now on you will fish for people  </s>
<s> so they pulled their boats up on shore  left everything and followed him </s>
<s> while jesus was in one of the towns  a man came along who was covered with leprosy  when he saw jesus  he fell with his face to the ground and begged him   lord  if you are willing  you can make me clean  </s>
<s> jesus reached out his hand and touched the man   i am willing   he said   be clean   and immediately the leprosy left him </s>
<s> then jesus ordered him   dont tell anyone  but go  show yourself to the priest and offer the sacrifices that moses commanded for your cleansing  as a testimony to them  </s>
<s> yet the news about him spread all the more  so that crowds of people came to hear him and to be healed of their illnesses </s>
<s> but jesus often withdrew to lonely places and prayed </s>
<s> one day jesus was teaching  and pharisees and teachers of the law were sitting there  they had come from every village of galilee and from judea and jerusalem  and the power of the lord was with jesus to heal those who were ill </s>
<s> some men came carrying a paralysed man on a mat and tried to take him into the house to lay him before jesus </s>
<s> when they could not find a way to do this because of the crowd  they went up on the roof and lowered him on his mat through the tiles into the middle of the crowd  right in front of jesus </s>
<s> when jesus saw their faith  he said   friend  your sins are forgiven  </s>
<s> the pharisees and the teachers of the law began thinking to themselves   who is this fellow who speaks blasphemy  who can forgive sins but god alone  </s>
<s> jesus knew what they were thinking and asked   why are you thinking these things in your hearts </s>
<s> which is easier  to say   your sins are forgiven   or to say   get up and walk  </s>
<s> but i want you to know that the son of man has authority on earth to forgive sins   so he said to the paralysed man   i tell you  get up  take your mat and go home  </s>
<s> immediately he stood up in front of them  took what he had been lying on and went home praising god </s>
<s> everyone was amazed and gave praise to god  they were filled with awe and said   we have seen remarkable things today  </s>
<s> after this  jesus went out and saw a tax collector by the name of levi sitting at his tax booth   follow me   jesus said to him </s>
<s> and levi got up  left everything and followed him </s>
<s> then levi held a great banquet for jesus at his house  and a large crowd of tax collectors and others were eating with them </s>
<s> but the pharisees and the teachers of the law who belonged to their sect complained to his disciples   why do you eat and drink with tax collectors and sinners  </s>

<s> they are like children sitting in the marketplace and calling out to each other    we played the pipe for you  and you did not dance  we sang a dirge  and you did not cry  </s>
<s> when one of the pharisees invited jesus to have dinner with him  he went to the pharisees house and reclined at the table </s>

<s> you did not give me a kiss  but this woman  from the time i entered  has not stopped kissing my feet </s>
<s> you did not put oil on my head  but she has poured perfume on my feet </s>
<s> therefore  i tell you  her many sins have been forgiven  as her great love has shown  but whoever has been forgiven little loves little  </s>

<s> the other guests began to say among themselves   who is this who even forgives sins  </s>
<s> jesus said to the woman   your faith has saved you  go in peace  </s>
<s> after this  jesus travelled about from one town and village to another  proclaiming the good news of the kingdom of god  the twelve were with him </s>

<s> some fell on rocky ground  and when it came up  the plants withered because they had no moisture </s>

<s> still other seed fell on good soil  it came up and yielded a crop  a hundred times more than was sown   when he said this  he called out   whoever has ears to hear  let them hear  </s>
<s> his disciples asked him what this parable meant </s>
<s> he said   the knowledge of the secrets of the kingdom of god has been given to you  but to others i speak in parables  so that    though seeing  they may not see  though hearing  they may not understand  </s>
<s>  this is the meaning of the parable  the seed is the word of god </s>
<s> those along the path are the ones who hear  and then the devil comes and takes away the word from their hearts  so that they may not believe and be saved </s>
<s> those on the rocky ground are the ones who receive the word with joy when they hear it  but they have no root  they believe for a while  but in the time of testing they fall away </s>
<s> the seed that fell among thorns stands for those who hear  but as they go on their way they are choked by lifes worries  riches and pleasures  and they do not mature </s>
<s> but the seed on good soil stands for those with a noble and good heart  who hear the word  retain it  and by persevering produce a crop </s>
<s>  no one lights a lamp and hides it in a clay jar or puts it under a bed  instead  they put it on a stand  so that those who come in can see the light </s>
<s> for there is nothing hidden that will not be disclosed  and nothing concealed that will not be known or brought out into the open </s>
<s> therefore consider carefully how you listen  whoever has will be given more  whoever does not have  even what they think they have will be taken from them  </s>
<s> now jesus mother and brothers came to see him  but they were not able to get near him because of the crowd </s>
<s> someone told him   your mother and brothers are standing outside  wanting to see you  </s>
<s> he replied   my mother and brothers are those who hear gods word and put it into practice  </s>
<s> one day jesus said to his disciples   let us go over to the other side of the lake   so they got into a boat and set out </s>
<s> as they sailed  he fell asleep  a squall came down on the lake  so that the boat was being swamped  and they were in great danger </s>
<s> the disciples went and woke him  saying   master  master  were going to drown   he got up and rebuked the wind and the raging waters  the storm subsided  and all was calm </s>
<s>  where is your faith   he asked his disciples  in fear and amazement they asked one another   who is this  he commands even the winds and the water  and they obey him  </s>
<s> they sailed to the region of the gerasenes  which is across the lake from galilee </s>
<s> when jesus stepped ashore  he was met by a demonpossessed man from the town  for a long time this man had not worn clothes or lived in a house  but had lived in the tombs </s>
<s> when he saw jesus  he cried out and fell at his feet  shouting at the top of his voice   what do you want with me  jesus  son of the most high god  i beg you  dont torture me  </s>
<s> for jesus had commanded the impure spirit to come out of the man  many times it had seized him  and though he was chained hand and foot and kept under guard  he had broken his chains and had been driven by the demon into solitary places </s>
<s> jesus asked him   what is your name    legion   he replied  because many demons had gone into him </s>
<s> and they begged jesus repeatedly not to order them to go into the abyss </s>
<s> a large herd of pigs was feeding there on the hillside  the demons begged jesus to let them go into the pigs  and he gave them permission </s>
<s> when the demons came out of the man  they went into the pigs  and the herd rushed down the steep bank into the lake and was drowned </s>
<s> when those tending the pigs saw what had happened  they ran off and reported this in the town and countryside </s>
<s> and the people went out to see what had happened  when they came to jesus  they found the man from whom the demons had gone out  sitting at jesus feet  dressed and in his right mind  and they were afraid </s>
<s> those who had seen it told the people how the demonpossessed man had been cured </s>
<s> then all the people of the region of the gerasenes asked jesus to leave them  because they were overcome with fear  so he got into the boat and left </s>
<s> the man from whom the demons had gone out begged to go with him  but jesus sent him away  saying </s>
<s>  return home and tell how much god has done for you   so the man went away and told all over the town how much jesus had done for him </s>
<s> now when jesus returned  a crowd welcomed him  for they were all expecting him </s>
<s> then a man named jairus  a synagogue leader  came and fell at jesus feet  pleading with him to come to his house</s>
<s> because his only daughter  a girl of about twelve  was dying  as jesus was on his way  the crowds almost crushed him </s>
<s> and a woman was there who had been subject to bleeding for twelve years  but no one could heal her </s>
<s> she came up behind him and touched the edge of his cloak  and immediately her bleeding stopped </s>
<s>  who touched me   jesus asked  when they all denied it  peter said   master  the people are crowding and pressing against you  </s>
<s> but jesus said   someone touched me  i know that power has gone out from me  </s>
<s> then the woman  seeing that she could not go unnoticed  came trembling and fell at his feet  in the presence of all the people  she told why she had touched him and how she had been instantly healed </s>
<s> then he said to her   daughter  your faith has healed you  go in peace  </s>
<s> while jesus was still speaking  someone came from the house of jairus  the synagogue leader   your daughter is dead   he said   dont bother the teacher anymore  </s>
<s> hearing this  jesus said to jairus   dont be afraid  just believe  and she will be healed  </s>
<s> when he arrived at the house of jairus  he did not let anyone go in with him except peter  john and james  and the childs father and mother </s>
<s> meanwhile  all the people were wailing and mourning for her   stop wailing   jesus said   she is not dead but asleep  </s>
<s> they laughed at him  knowing that she was dead </s>
<s> but he took her by the hand and said   my child  get up  </s>
<s> her spirit returned  and at once she stood up  then jesus told them to give her something to eat </s>
<s> her parents were astonished  but he ordered them not to tell anyone what had happened </s>
<s> when jesus had called the twelve together  he gave them power and authority to drive out all demons and to cure diseases </s>
<s> and he sent them out to proclaim the kingdom of god and to heal those who were ill </s>
<s> he told them   take nothing for the journey  no staff  no bag  no bread  no money  no extra shirt </s>
<s> whatever house you enter  stay there until you leave that town </s>
<s> if people do not welcome you  leave their town and shake the dust off your feet as a testimony against them  </s>
<s> so they set out and went from village to village  proclaiming the good news and healing people everywhere </s>
<s> now herod the tetrarch heard about all that was going on  and he was perplexed because some were saying that john had been raised from the dead </s>

<s> but herod said   i beheaded john  who  then  is this i hear such things about   and he tried to see him </s>
<s> when the apostles returned  they reported to jesus what they had done  then he took them with him and they withdrew by themselves to a town called bethsaida </s>
<s> but the crowds learned about it and followed him  he welcomed them and spoke to them about the kingdom of god  and healed those who needed healing </s>
<s> late in the afternoon the twelve came to him and said   send the crowd away so they can go to the surrounding villages and countryside and find food and lodging  because we are in a remote place here  </s>
<s> he replied   you give them something to eat   they answered   we have only five loaves of bread and two fish  unless we go and buy food for all this crowd  </s>
<s>  about five thousand men were there   but he said to his disciples   make them sit down in groups of about fifty each  </s>
<s> the disciples did so  and everyone sat down </s>
<s> taking the five loaves and the two fish and looking up to heaven  he gave thanks and broke them  then he gave them to the disciples to distribute to the people </s>
<s> they all ate and were satisfied  and the disciples picked up twelve basketfuls of broken pieces that were left over </s>
<s> once when jesus was praying in private and his disciples were with him  he asked them   who do the crowds say i am  </s>
<s> they replied   some say john the baptist  others say elijah  and still others  that one of the prophets of long ago has come back to life  </s>
<s>  but what about you   he asked   who do you say i am   peter answered   gods messiah  </s>
<s> jesus strictly warned them not to tell this to anyone </s>
<s> and he said   the son of man must suffer many things and be rejected by the elders  the chief priests and the teachers of the law  and he must be killed and on the third day be raised to life  </s>
<s> then he said to them all   whoever wants to be my disciple must deny themselves and take up their cross daily and follow me </s>
<s> for whoever wants to save their life will lose it  but whoever loses their life for me will save it </s>
<s> what good is it for someone to gain the whole world  and yet lose or forfeit their very self </s>
<s> whoever is ashamed of me and my words  the son of man will be ashamed of them when he comes in his glory and in the glory of the father and of the holy angels </s>
<s>  truly i tell you  some who are standing here will not taste death before they see the kingdom of god  </s>
<s> about eight days after jesus said this  he took peter  john and james with him and went up onto a mountain to pray </s>

<s> a voice came from the cloud  saying   this is my son  whom i have chosen  listen to him  </s>
<s> when the voice had spoken  they found that jesus was alone  the disciples kept this to themselves and did not tell anyone at that time what they had seen </s>
<s> the next day  when they came down from the mountain  a large crowd met him </s>
<s> a man in the crowd called out   teacher  i beg you to look at my son  for he is my only child </s>
<s> a spirit seizes him and he suddenly screams  it throws him into convulsions so that he foams at the mouth  it scarcely ever leaves him and is destroying him </s>
<s> i begged your disciples to drive it out  but they could not  </s>
<s>  you unbelieving and perverse generation   jesus replied   how long shall i stay with you and put up with you  bring your son here  </s>
<s> even while the boy was coming  the demon threw him to the ground in a convulsion  but jesus rebuked the impure spirit  healed the boy and gave him back to his father </s>
<s> and they were all amazed at the greatness of god  while everyone was marvelling at all that jesus did  he said to his disciples </s>
<s>  listen carefully to what i am about to tell you  the son of man is going to be delivered into the hands of men  </s>
<s> but they did not understand what this meant  it was hidden from them  so that they did not grasp it  and they were afraid to ask him about it </s>
<s> an argument started among the disciples as to which of them would be the greatest </s>
<s> jesus  knowing their thoughts  took a little child and made him stand beside him </s>
<s> then he said to them   whoever welcomes this little child in my name welcomes me  and whoever welcomes me welcomes the one who sent me  for it is the one who is least among you all who is the greatest  </s>
<s>  master   said john   we saw someone driving out demons in your name and we tried to stop him  because he is not one of us  </s>
<s>  do not stop him   jesus said   for whoever is not against you is for you  </s>
<s> as the time approached for him to be taken up to heaven  jesus resolutely set out for jerusalem </s>
<s> and he sent messengers on ahead  who went into a samaritan village to get things ready for him </s>
<s> but the people there did not welcome him  because he was heading for jerusalem </s>
<s> when the disciples james and john saw this  they asked   lord  do you want us to call fire down from heaven to destroy them  </s>
<s> but jesus turned and rebuked them </s>
<s> then he and his disciples went to another village </s>
<s> as they were walking along the road  a man said to him   i will follow you wherever you go  </s>
<s> jesus replied   foxes have dens and birds have nests  but the son of man has nowhere to lay his head  </s>
<s> he said to another man   follow me   but he replied   lord  first let me go and bury my father  </s>
<s> jesus said to him   let the dead bury their own dead  but you go and proclaim the kingdom of god  </s>
<s> still another said   i will follow you  lord  but first let me go back and say goodbye to my family  </s>
<s> jesus replied   no one who puts a hand to the plough and looks back is fit for service in the kingdom of god  </s>
<s> after this the lord appointed seventytwo others and sent them two by two ahead of him to every town and place where he was about to go </s>
<s> he told them   the harvest is plentiful  but the workers are few  ask the lord of the harvest  therefore  to send out workers into his harvest field </s>
<s> go  i am sending you out like lambs among wolves </s>
<s> do not take a purse or bag or sandals  and do not greet anyone on the road </s>
<s>  when you enter a house  first say   peace to this house  </s>
<s> if someone who promotes peace is there  your peace will rest on them  if not  it will return to you </s>
<s> stay there  eating and drinking whatever they give you  for the worker deserves his wages  do not move around from house to house </s>
<s>  when you enter a town and are welcomed  eat what is offered to you </s>
<s> heal those there who are ill and tell them   the kingdom of god has come near to you  </s>
<s> but when you enter a town and are not welcomed  go into its streets and say </s>
<s>  even the dust of your town we wipe from our feet as a warning to you  yet be sure of this  the kingdom of god has come near  </s>
<s> i tell you  it will be more bearable on that day for sodom than for that town </s>

<s>  whoever listens to you listens to me  whoever rejects you rejects me  but whoever rejects me rejects him who sent me  </s>
<s> the seventytwo returned with joy and said   lord  even the demons submit to us in your name  </s>
<s> he replied   i saw satan fall like lightning from heaven </s>
<s> i have given you authority to trample on snakes and scorpions and to overcome all the power of the enemy  nothing will harm you </s>
<s> however  do not rejoice that the spirits submit to you  but rejoice that your names are written in heaven  </s>

<s> the apostles said to the lord   increase our faith  </s>
<s> he replied   if you have faith as small as a mustard seed  you can say to this mulberry tree   be uprooted and planted in the sea   and it will obey you </s>
<s>  suppose one of you has a servant ploughing or looking after the sheep  will he say to the servant when he comes in from the field   come along now and sit down to eat  </s>
<s> wont he rather say   prepare my supper  get yourself ready and wait on me while i eat and drink  after that you may eat and drink  </s>
<s> will he thank the servant because he did what he was told to do </s>
<s> so you also  when you have done everything you were told to do  should say   we are unworthy servants  we have only done our duty   </s>
<s> now on his way to jerusalem  jesus travelled along the border between samaria and galilee </s>
<s> as he was going into a village  ten men who had leprosy met him  they stood at a distance</s>
<s> and called out in a loud voice   jesus  master  have pity on us  </s>
<s> when he saw them  he said   go  show yourselves to the priests   and as they went  they were cleansed </s>
<s> one of them  when he saw he was healed  came back  praising god in a loud voice </s>
<s> he threw himself at jesus feet and thanked him  and he was a samaritan </s>
<s> jesus asked   were not all ten cleansed  where are the other nine </s>
<s> has no one returned to give praise to god except this foreigner  </s>
<s> then he said to him   rise and go  your faith has made you well  </s>
<s> once  on being asked by the pharisees when the kingdom of god would come  jesus replied   the coming of the kingdom of god is not something that can be observed </s>
<s> nor will people say   here it is   or  there it is   because the kingdom of god is in your midst  </s>
<s> then he said to his disciples   the time is coming when you will long to see one of the days of the son of man  but you will not see it </s>
<s> people will tell you   there he is   or  here he is   do not go running off after them </s>
<s> for the son of man in his day will be like the lightning  which flashes and lights up the sky from one end to the other </s>
<s> but first he must suffer many things and be rejected by this generation </s>
<s>  just as it was in the days of noah  so also will it be in the days of the son of man </s>
<s> people were eating  drinking  marrying and being given in marriage up to the day noah entered the ark  then the flood came and destroyed them all </s>
<s>  it was the same in the days of lot  people were eating and drinking  buying and selling  planting and building </s>
<s> but the day lot left sodom  fire and sulphur rained down from heaven and destroyed them all </s>
<s>  it will be just like this on the day the son of man is revealed </s>
<s> on that day no one who is on the housetop  with possessions inside  should go down to get them  likewise  no one in the field should go back for anything </s>
<s> remember lots wife </s>

<s> </s>
<s>  where  lord   they asked  he replied   where there is a dead body  there the vultures will gather  </s>
<s> then jesus told his disciples a parable to show them that they should always pray and not give up </s>
<s> he said   in a certain town there was a judge who neither feared god nor cared what people thought </s>
<s> and there was a widow in that town who kept coming to him with the plea   grant me justice against my adversary  </s>
<s>  for some time he refused  but finally he said to himself   even though i dont fear god or care what people think </s>
<s> yet because this widow keeps bothering me  i will see that she gets justice  so that she wont eventually come and attack me   </s>
<s> and the lord said   listen to what the unjust judge says </s>
<s> and will not god bring about justice for his chosen ones  who cry out to him day and night  will he keep putting them off </s>
<s> i tell you  he will see that they get justice  and quickly  however  when the son of man comes  will he find faith on the earth  </s>
<s> to some who were confident of their own righteousness and looked down on everyone else  jesus told this parable </s>
<s>  two men went up to the temple to pray  one a pharisee and the other a tax collector </s>
<s> the pharisee stood by himself and prayed   god  i thank you that i am not like other people  robbers  evildoers  adulterers  or even like this tax collector </s>
<s> i fast twice a week and give a tenth of all i get  </s>
<s>  but the tax collector stood at a distance  he would not even look up to heaven  but beat his breast and said   god  have mercy on me  a sinner  </s>
<s>  i tell you that this man  rather than the other  went home justified before god  for all those who exalt themselves will be humbled  and those who humble themselves will be exalted  </s>
<s> people were also bringing babies to jesus for him to place his hands on them  when the disciples saw this  they rebuked them </s>
<s> but jesus called the children to him and said   let the little children come to me  and do not hinder them  for the kingdom of god belongs to such as these </s>
<s> truly i tell you  anyone who will not receive the kingdom of god like a little child will never enter it  </s>
<s> a certain ruler asked him   good teacher  what must i do to inherit eternal life  </s>
<s>  why do you call me good   jesus answered   no one is good  except god alone </s>
<s> you know the commandments   you shall not commit adultery  you shall not murder  you shall not steal  you shall not give false testimony  honour your father and mother   </s>
<s>  all these i have kept since i was a boy   he said </s>
<s> when jesus heard this  he said to him   you still lack one thing  sell everything you have and give to the poor  and you will have treasure in heaven  then come  follow me  </s>
<s> when he heard this  he became very sad  because he was very wealthy </s>
<s> jesus looked at him and said   how hard it is for the rich to enter the kingdom of god </s>
<s> indeed  it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of god  </s>
<s> those who heard this asked   who then can be saved  </s>
<s> jesus replied   what is impossible with man is possible with god  </s>
<s> peter said to him   we have left all we had to follow you  </s>
<s>  truly i tell you   jesus said to them   no one who has left home or wife or brothers or sisters or parents or children for the sake of the kingdom of god</s>
<s> will fail to receive many times as much in this age  and in the age to come eternal life  </s>
<s> jesus took the twelve aside and told them   we are going up to jerusalem  and everything that is written by the prophets about the son of man will be fulfilled </s>
<s> he will be handed over to the gentiles  they will mock him  insult him and spit on him </s>
<s> they will flog him and kill him  on the third day he will rise again  </s>
<s> the disciples did not understand any of this  its meaning was hidden from them  and they did not know what he was talking about </s>
<s> as jesus approached jericho  a blind man was sitting by the roadside begging </s>
<s> when he heard the crowd going by  he asked what was happening </s>
<s> they told him   jesus of nazareth is passing by  </s>
<s> he called out   jesus  son of david  have mercy on me  </s>
<s> those who led the way rebuked him and told him to be quiet  but he shouted all the more   son of david  have mercy on me  </s>
<s> jesus stopped and ordered the man to be brought to him  when he came near  jesus asked him </s>
<s>  what do you want me to do for you    lord  i want to see   he replied </s>
<s> jesus said to him   receive your sight  your faith has healed you  </s>
<s> immediately he received his sight and followed jesus  praising god  when all the people saw it  they also praised god </s>
<s> jesus entered jericho and was passing through </s>
<s> a man was there by the name of zacchaeus  he was a chief tax collector and was wealthy </s>
<s> he wanted to see who jesus was  but because he was short he could not see over the crowd </s>
<s> so he ran ahead and climbed a sycamorefig tree to see him  since jesus was coming that way </s>
<s> when jesus reached the spot  he looked up and said to him   zacchaeus  come down immediately  i must stay at your house today  </s>
<s> so he came down at once and welcomed him gladly </s>
<s> all the people saw this and began to mutter   he has gone to be the guest of a sinner  </s>
<s> but zacchaeus stood up and said to the lord   look  lord  here and now i give half of my possessions to the poor  and if i have cheated anybody out of anything  i will pay back four times the amount  </s>
<s> jesus said to him   today salvation has come to this house  because this man  too  is a son of abraham </s>
<s> for the son of man came to seek and to save the lost  </s>
<s> while they were listening to this  he went on to tell them a parable  because he was near jerusalem and the people thought that the kingdom of god was going to appear at once </s>
<s> he said   a man of noble birth went to a distant country to have himself appointed king and then to return </s>
<s> so he called ten of his servants and gave them ten minas   put this money to work   he said   until i come back  </s>
<s>  but his subjects hated him and sent a delegation after him to say   we dont want this man to be our king  </s>
<s>  he was made king  however  and returned home  then he sent for the servants to whom he had given the money  in order to find out what they had gained with it </s>
<s>  the first one came and said   sir  your mina has earned ten more  </s>
<s>   well done  my good servant   his master replied   because you have been trustworthy in a very small matter  take charge of ten cities  </s>
<s>  the second came and said   sir  your mina has earned five more  </s>
<s>  his master answered   you take charge of five cities  </s>
<s>  then another servant came and said   sir  here is your mina  i have kept it laid away in a piece of cloth </s>
<s> i was afraid of you  because you are a hard man  you take out what you did not put in and reap what you did not sow  </s>
<s>  his master replied   i will judge you by your own words  you wicked servant  you knew  did you  that i am a hard man  taking out what i did not put in  and reaping what i did not sow </s>
<s> why then didnt you put my money on deposit  so that when i came back  i could have collected it with interest  </s>
<s>  then he said to those standing by   take his mina away from him and give it to the one who has ten minas  </s>
<s>   sir   they said   he already has ten  </s>
<s>  he replied   i tell you that to everyone who has  more will be given  but as for the one who has nothing  even what they have will be taken away </s>
<s> but those enemies of mine who did not want me to be king over them  bring them here and kill them in front of me   </s>
<s> after jesus had said this  he went on ahead  going up to jerusalem </s>
<s> as he approached bethphage and bethany at the hill called the mount of olives  he sent two of his disciples  saying to them </s>
<s>  go to the village ahead of you  and as you enter it  you will find a colt tied there  which no one has ever ridden  untie it and bring it here </s>
<s> if anyone asks you   why are you untying it   say   the lord needs it   </s>
<s> those who were sent ahead went and found it just as he had told them </s>
<s> as they were untying the colt  its owners asked them   why are you untying the colt  </s>
<s> they replied   the lord needs it  </s>
<s> they brought it to jesus  threw their cloaks on the colt and put jesus on it </s>
<s> as he went along  people spread their cloaks on the road </s>
<s> when he came near the place where the road goes down the mount of olives  the whole crowd of disciples began joyfully to praise god in loud voices for all the miracles they had seen </s>
<s>  blessed is the king who comes in the name of the lord    peace in heaven and glory in the highest  </s>
<s> some of the pharisees in the crowd said to jesus   teacher  rebuke your disciples  </s>
<s>  i tell you   he replied   if they keep quiet  the stones will cry out  </s>
<s> as he approached jerusalem and saw the city  he wept over it</s>
<s> and said   if you  even you  had only known on this day what would bring you peace  but now it is hidden from your eyes </s>
<s> the days will come upon you when your enemies will build an embankment against you and encircle you and hem you in on every side </s>
<s> they will dash you to the ground  you and the children within your walls  they will not leave one stone on another  because you did not recognise the time of gods coming to you  </s>
<s> when jesus entered the temple courts  he began to drive out those who were selling </s>
<s>  it is written   he said to them    my house will be a house of prayer   but you have made it  a den of robbers   </s>
<s> every day he was teaching at the temple  but the chief priests  the teachers of the law and the leaders among the people were trying to kill him </s>
<s> yet they could not find any way to do it  because all the people hung on his words </s>
<s> one day as jesus was teaching the people in the temple courts and proclaiming the good news  the chief priests and the teachers of the law  together with the elders  came up to him </s>
<s>  tell us by what authority you are doing these things   they said   who gave you this authority  </s>
<s> he replied   i will also ask you a question  tell me </s>
<s> johns baptism  was it from heaven  or of human origin  </s>
<s> they discussed it among themselves and said   if we say   from heaven   he will ask   why didnt you believe him  </s>
<s> but if we say   of human origin   all the people will stone us  because they are persuaded that john was a prophet  </s>
<s> so they answered   we dont know where it was from  </s>
<s> jesus said   neither will i tell you by what authority i am doing these things  </s>
<s> he went on to tell the people this parable   a man planted a vineyard  rented it to some farmers and went away for a long time </s>
<s> at harvest time he sent a servant to the tenants so they would give him some of the fruit of the vineyard  but the tenants beat him and sent him away emptyhanded </s>
<s> he sent another servant  but that one also they beat and treated shamefully and sent away emptyhanded </s>
<s> he sent still a third  and they wounded him and threw him out </s>
<s>  then the owner of the vineyard said   what shall i do  i will send my son  whom i love  perhaps they will respect him  </s>
<s>  but when the tenants saw him  they talked the matter over   this is the heir   they said   lets kill him  and the inheritance will be ours  </s>
<s> so they threw him out of the vineyard and killed him   what then will the owner of the vineyard do to them </s>
<s> he will come and kill those tenants and give the vineyard to others   when the people heard this  they said   god forbid  </s>
<s> jesus looked directly at them and asked   then what is the meaning of that which is written    the stone the builders rejected has become the cornerstone  </s>
<s> the teachers of the law and the chief priests looked for a way to arrest him immediately  because they knew he had spoken this parable against them  but they were afraid of the people </s>
<s> keeping a close watch on him  they sent spies  who pretended to be sincere  they hoped to catch jesus in something he said  so that they might hand him over to the power and authority of the governor </s>
<s> so the spies questioned him   teacher  we know that you speak and teach what is right  and that you do not show partiality but teach the way of god in accordance with the truth </s>
<s> is it right for us to pay taxes to caesar or not  </s>
<s> he saw through their duplicity and said to them </s>
<s>  show me a denarius  whose image and inscription are on it    caesars   they replied </s>
<s> he said to them   then give back to caesar what is caesars  and to god what is gods  </s>
<s> they were unable to trap him in what he had said there in public  and astonished by his answer  they became silent </s>
<s> some of the sadducees  who say there is no resurrection  came to jesus with a question </s>
<s>  teacher   they said   moses wrote for us that if a mans brother dies and leaves a wife but no children  the man must marry the widow and raise up offspring for his brother </s>
<s> now there were seven brothers  the first one married a woman and died childless </s>
<s> the second</s>
<s> and then the third married her  and in the same way the seven died  leaving no children </s>
<s> finally  the woman died too </s>
<s> now then  at the resurrection whose wife will she be  since the seven were married to her  </s>
<s> jesus replied   the people of this age marry and are given in marriage </s>
<s> but those who are considered worthy of taking part in the age to come and in the resurrection from the dead will neither marry nor be given in marriage </s>
<s> and they can no longer die  for they are like the angels  they are gods children  since they are children of the resurrection </s>
<s> but in the account of the burning bush  even moses showed that the dead rise  for he calls the lord  the god of abraham  and the god of isaac  and the god of jacob  </s>
<s> he is not the god of the dead  but of the living  for to him all are alive  </s>
<s> some of the teachers of the law responded   well said  teacher  </s>
<s> and no one dared to ask him any more questions </s>
<s> then jesus said to them   why is it said that the messiah is the son of david </s>
<s> david himself declares in the book of psalms    the lord said to my lord   sit at my right hand</s>
<s> until i make your enemies a footstool for your feet   </s>
<s> while all the people were listening  jesus said to his disciples </s>
<s>  beware of the teachers of the law  they like to walk around in flowing robes and love to be greeted with respect in the marketplaces and have the most important seats in the synagogues and the places of honour at banquets </s>
<s> they devour widows houses and for a show make lengthy prayers  these men will be punished most severely  </s>
<s> as jesus looked up  he saw the rich putting their gifts into the temple treasury </s>
<s> he also saw a poor widow put in two very small copper coins </s>
<s>  truly i tell you   he said   this poor widow has put in more than all the others </s>
<s> all these people gave their gifts out of their wealth  but she out of her poverty put in all she had to live on  </s>
<s> some of his disciples were remarking about how the temple was adorned with beautiful stones and with gifts dedicated to god  but jesus said </s>
<s>  as for what you see here  the time will come when not one stone will be left on another  every one of them will be thrown down  </s>
<s>  teacher   they asked   when will these things happen  and what will be the sign that they are about to take place  </s>
<s> he replied   watch out that you are not deceived  for many will come in my name  claiming   i am he   and   the time is near   do not follow them </s>
<s> when you hear of wars and uprisings  do not be frightened  these things must happen first  but the end will not come right away  </s>
<s> then he said to them   nation will rise against nation  and kingdom against kingdom </s>
<s> there will be great earthquakes  famines and pestilences in various places  and fearful events and great signs from heaven </s>
<s>  but before all this  they will seize you and persecute you  they will hand you over to synagogues and put you in prison  and you will be brought before kings and governors  and all on account of my name </s>
<s> and so you will bear testimony to me </s>
<s> but make up your mind not to worry beforehand how you will defend yourselves </s>
<s> for i will give you words and wisdom that none of your adversaries will be able to resist or contradict </s>
<s> you will be betrayed even by parents  brothers and sisters  relatives and friends  and they will put some of you to death </s>
<s> everyone will hate you because of me </s>
<s> but not a hair of your head will perish </s>
<s> stand firm  and you will win life </s>
<s>  when you see jerusalem being surrounded by armies  you will know that its desolation is near </s>
<s> then let those who are in judea flee to the mountains  let those in the city get out  and let those in the country not enter the city </s>
<s> for this is the time of punishment in fulfilment of all that has been written </s>
<s> how dreadful it will be in those days for pregnant women and nursing mothers  there will be great distress in the land and wrath against this people </s>
<s> they will fall by the sword and will be taken as prisoners to all the nations  jerusalem will be trampled on by the gentiles until the times of the gentiles are fulfilled </s>
<s>  there will be signs in the sun  moon and stars  on the earth  nations will be in anguish and perplexity at the roaring and tossing of the sea </s>
<s> people will faint from terror  apprehensive of what is coming on the world  for the heavenly bodies will be shaken </s>
<s> at that time they will see the son of man coming in a cloud with power and great glory </s>
<s> when these things begin to take place  stand up and lift up your heads  because your redemption is drawing near  </s>
<s> he told them this parable   look at the figtree and all the trees </s>
<s> when they sprout leaves  you can see for yourselves and know that summer is near </s>
<s> even so  when you see these things happening  you know that the kingdom of god is near </s>
<s>  truly i tell you  this generation will certainly not pass away until all these things have happened </s>
<s> heaven and earth will pass away  but my words will never pass away </s>
<s>  be careful  or your hearts will be weighed down with carousing  drunkenness and the anxieties of life  and that day will close on you suddenly like a trap </s>
<s> for it will come on all those who live on the face of the whole earth </s>
<s> be always on the watch  and pray that you may be able to escape all that is about to happen  and that you may be able to stand before the son of man  </s>
<s> each day jesus was teaching at the temple  and each evening he went out to spend the night on the hill called the mount of olives </s>
<s> and all the people came early in the morning to hear him at the temple </s>
<s> now the festival of unleavened bread  called the passover  was approaching </s>
<s> and the chief priests and the teachers of the law were looking for some way to get rid of jesus  for they were afraid of the people </s>
<s> then satan entered judas  called iscariot  one of the twelve </s>
<s> and judas went to the chief priests and the officers of the temple guard and discussed with them how he might betray jesus </s>
<s> they were delighted and agreed to give him money </s>
<s> he consented  and watched for an opportunity to hand jesus over to them when no crowd was present </s>
<s> then came the day of unleavened bread on which the passover lamb had to be sacrificed </s>
<s> jesus sent peter and john  saying   go and make preparations for us to eat the passover  </s>
<s>  where do you want us to prepare for it   they asked </s>
<s> he replied   as you enter the city  a man carrying a jar of water will meet you  follow him to the house that he enters </s>
<s> and say to the owner of the house   the teacher asks  where is the guest room  where i may eat the passover with my disciples  </s>
<s> he will show you a large room upstairs  all furnished  make preparations there  </s>
<s> they left and found things just as jesus had told them  so they prepared the passover </s>

<s> and he said to them   i have eagerly desired to eat this passover with you before i suffer </s>
<s> for i tell you  i will not eat it again until it finds fulfilment in the kingdom of god  </s>
<s> after taking the cup  he gave thanks and said   take this and divide it among you </s>
<s> for i tell you i will not drink again from the fruit of the vine until the kingdom of god comes  </s>
<s> and he took bread  gave thanks and broke it  and gave it to them  saying   this is my body given for you  do this in remembrance of me  </s>
<s> in the same way  after the supper he took the cup  saying   this cup is the new covenant in my blood  which is poured out for you </s>
<s> but the hand of him who is going to betray me is with mine on the table </s>
<s> the son of man will go as it has been decreed  but woe to that man who betrays him  </s>
<s> they began to question among themselves which of them it might be who would do this </s>
<s> a dispute also arose among them as to which of them was considered to be greatest </s>
<s> jesus said to them   the kings of the gentiles lord it over them  and those who exercise authority over them call themselves benefactors </s>
<s> but you are not to be like that  instead  the greatest among you should be like the youngest  and the one who rules like the one who serves </s>
<s> for who is greater  the one who is at the table or the one who serves  is it not the one who is at the table  but i am among you as one who serves </s>
<s> you are those who have stood by me in my trials </s>
<s> and i confer on you a kingdom  just as my father conferred one on me </s>
<s> so that you may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom and sit on thrones  judging the twelve tribes of israel </s>
<s>  simon  simon  satan has asked to sift all of you as wheat </s>
<s> but i have prayed for you  simon  that your faith may not fail  and when you have turned back  strengthen your brothers  </s>
<s> but he replied   lord  i am ready to go with you to prison and to death  </s>
<s> jesus answered   i tell you  peter  before the cock crows today  you will deny three times that you know me  </s>
<s> then jesus asked them   when i sent you without purse  bag or sandals  did you lack anything    nothing   they answered </s>
<s> he said to them   but now if you have a purse  take it  and also a bag  and if you dont have a sword  sell your cloak and buy one </s>
<s> it is written   and he was numbered with the transgressors   and i tell you that this must be fulfilled in me  yes  what is written about me is reaching its fulfilment  </s>
<s> the disciples said   see  lord  here are two swords    thats enough   he replied </s>
<s> jesus went out as usual to the mount of olives  and his disciples followed him </s>
<s> on reaching the place  he said to them   pray that you will not fall into temptation  </s>
<s> he withdrew about a stones throw beyond them  knelt down and prayed </s>
<s>  father  if you are willing  take this cup from me  yet not my will  but yours be done  </s>
<s> an angel from heaven appeared to him and strengthened him </s>
<s> and being in anguish  he prayed more earnestly  and his sweat was like drops of blood falling to the ground </s>
<s> when he rose from prayer and went back to the disciples  he found them asleep  exhausted from sorrow </s>
<s>  why are you sleeping   he asked them   get up and pray so that you will not fall into temptation  </s>
<s> while he was still speaking a crowd came up  and the man who was called judas  one of the twelve  was leading them  he approached jesus to kiss him </s>
<s> but jesus asked him   judas  are you betraying the son of man with a kiss  </s>
<s> when jesus followers saw what was going to happen  they said   lord  should we strike with our swords  </s>
<s> and one of them struck the servant of the high priest  cutting off his right ear </s>
<s> but jesus answered   no more of this   and he touched the mans ear and healed him </s>
<s> then jesus said to the chief priests  the officers of the temple guard  and the elders  who had come for him   am i leading a rebellion  that you have come with swords and clubs </s>
<s> every day i was with you in the temple courts  and you did not lay a hand on me  but this is your hour  when darkness reigns  </s>
<s> then seizing him  they led him away and took him into the house of the high priest  peter followed at a distance </s>
<s> and when some there had kindled a fire in the middle of the courtyard and had sat down together  peter sat down with them </s>
<s> a servantgirl saw him seated there in the firelight  she looked closely at him and said   this man was with him  </s>
<s> but he denied it   woman  i dont know him   he said </s>
<s> a little later someone else saw him and said   you also are one of them    man  i am not   peter replied </s>
<s> about an hour later another asserted   certainly this fellow was with him  for he is a galilean  </s>
<s> peter replied   man  i dont know what youre talking about   just as he was speaking  the cock crowed </s>
<s> the lord turned and looked straight at peter  then peter remembered the word the lord had spoken to him   before the cock crows today  you will disown me three times  </s>
<s> and he went outside and wept bitterly </s>

<s> they all asked   are you then the son of god   he replied   you say that i am  </s>
<s> then they said   why do we need any more testimony  we have heard it from his own lips  </s>
<s> then the whole assembly rose and led him off to pilate </s>

<s> so pilate asked jesus   are you the king of the jews    you have said so   jesus replied </s>
<s> then pilate announced to the chief priests and the crowd   i find no basis for a charge against this man  </s>
<s> but they insisted   he stirs up the people all over judea by his teaching  he started in galilee and has come all the way here  </s>
<s> on hearing this  pilate asked if the man was a galilean </s>
<s> when he learned that jesus was under herods jurisdiction  he sent him to herod  who was also in jerusalem at that time </s>

<s> the chief priests and the teachers of the law were standing there  vehemently accusing him </s>
<s> then herod and his soldiers ridiculed and mocked him  dressing him in an elegant robe  they sent him back to pilate </s>
<s> that day herod and pilate became friends  before this they had been enemies </s>
<s> pilate called together the chief priests  the rulers and the people </s>
<s> and said to them   you brought me this man as one who was inciting the people to rebellion  i have examined him in your presence and have found no basis for your charges against him </s>
<s> neither has herod  for he sent him back to us  as you can see  he has done nothing to deserve death </s>
<s> therefore  i will punish him and then release him   </s>
<s> </s>
<s> but the whole crowd shouted   away with this man  release barabbas to us  </s>
<s>  barabbas had been thrown into prison for an insurrection in the city  and for murder  </s>
<s> wanting to release jesus  pilate appealed to them again </s>
<s> but they kept shouting   crucify him  crucify him  </s>
<s> for the third time he spoke to them   why  what crime has this man committed  i have found in him no grounds for the death penalty  therefore i will have him punished and then release him  </s>
<s> but with loud shouts they insistently demanded that he be crucified  and their shouts prevailed </s>
<s> so pilate decided to grant their demand </s>
<s> he released the man who had been thrown into prison for insurrection and murder  the one they asked for  and surrendered jesus to their will </s>
<s> as the soldiers led him away  they seized simon from cyrene  who was on his way in from the country  and put the cross on him and made him carry it behind jesus </s>
<s> a large number of people followed him  including women who mourned and wailed for him </s>
<s> jesus turned and said to them   daughters of jerusalem  do not weep for me  weep for yourselves and for your children </s>
<s> for the time will come when you will say   blessed are the childless women  the wombs that never bore and the breasts that never nursed  </s>
<s> then   they will say to the mountains   fall on us   and to the hills   cover us   </s>
<s> two other men  both criminals  were also led out with him to be executed </s>
<s> when they came to the place called the skull  they crucified him there  along with the criminals  one on his right  the other on his left </s>
<s> jesus said   father  forgive them  for they do not know what they are doing   and they divided up his clothes by casting lots </s>
<s> the people stood watching  and the rulers even sneered at him  they said   he saved others  let him save himself if he is gods messiah  the chosen one  </s>
<s> the soldiers also came up and mocked him  they offered him wine vinegar</s>
<s> and said   if you are the king of the jews  save yourself  </s>
<s> there was a written notice above him  which read  this is the king of the jews </s>
<s> one of the criminals who hung there hurled insults at him   arent you the messiah  save yourself and us  </s>
<s> but the other criminal rebuked him   dont you fear god   he said   since you are under the same sentence </s>
<s> we are punished justly  for we are getting what our deeds deserve  but this man has done nothing wrong  </s>
<s> then he said   jesus  remember me when you come into your kingdom  </s>
<s> jesus answered him   truly i tell you  today you will be with me in paradise  </s>
<s> it was now about noon  and darkness came over the whole land until three in the afternoon </s>
<s> for the sun stopped shining  and the curtain of the temple was torn in two </s>
<s> jesus called out with a loud voice   father  into your hands i commit my spirit   when he had said this  he breathed his last </s>
<s> the centurion  seeing what had happened  praised god and said   surely this was a righteous man  </s>
<s> when all the people who had gathered to witness this sight saw what took place  they beat their breasts and went away </s>
<s> but all those who knew him  including the women who had followed him from galilee  stood at a distance  watching these things </s>
<s> now there was a man named joseph  a member of the council  a good and upright man </s>
<s> who had not consented to their decision and action  he came from the judean town of arimathea  and he himself was waiting for the kingdom of god </s>
<s> going to pilate  he asked for jesus body </s>
<s> then he took it down  wrapped it in linen cloth and placed it in a tomb cut in the rock  one in which no one had yet been laid </s>
<s> it was preparation day  and the sabbath was about to begin </s>
<s> the women who had come with jesus from galilee followed joseph and saw the tomb and how his body was laid in it </s>
<s> then they went home and prepared spices and perfumes  but they rested on the sabbath in obedience to the commandment </s>
<s> on the first day of the week  very early in the morning  the women took the spices they had prepared and went to the tomb </s>
<s> they found the stone rolled away from the tomb </s>
<s> but when they entered  they did not find the body of the lord jesus </s>
<s> while they were wondering about this  suddenly two men in clothes that gleamed like lightning stood beside them </s>
<s> in their fright the women bowed down with their faces to the ground  but the men said to them   why do you look for the living among the dead </s>
<s> he is not here  he has risen  remember how he told you  while he was still with you in galilee </s>
<s>  the son of man must be delivered over to the hands of sinners  be crucified and on the third day be raised again   </s>
<s> then they remembered his words </s>
<s> when they came back from the tomb  they told all these things to the eleven and to all the others </s>
<s> it was mary magdalene  joanna  mary the mother of james  and the others with them who told this to the apostles </s>
<s> but they did not believe the women  because their words seemed to them like nonsense </s>
<s> peter  however  got up and ran to the tomb  bending over  he saw the strips of linen lying by themselves  and he went away  wondering to himself what had happened </s>
<s> now that same day two of them were going to a village called emmaus  about seven miles from jerusalem </s>
<s> they were talking with each other about everything that had happened </s>
<s> as they talked and discussed these things with each other  jesus himself came up and walked along with them </s>
<s> but they were kept from recognising him </s>
<s> he asked them   what are you discussing together as you walk along   they stood still  their faces downcast </s>
<s> one of them  named cleopas  asked him   are you the only one visiting jerusalem who does not know the things that have happened there in these days  </s>
<s>  what things   he asked   about jesus of nazareth   they replied   he was a prophet  powerful in word and deed before god and all the people </s>
<s> the chief priests and our rulers handed him over to be sentenced to death  and they crucified him </s>
<s> but we had hoped that he was the one who was going to redeem israel  and what is more  it is the third day since all this took place </s>
<s> in addition  some of our women amazed us  they went to the tomb early this morning</s>
<s> but didnt find his body  they came and told us that they had seen a vision of angels  who said he was alive </s>
<s> then some of our companions went to the tomb and found it just as the women had said  but they did not see jesus  </s>
<s> he said to them   how foolish you are  and how slow to believe all that the prophets have spoken </s>
<s> did not the messiah have to suffer these things and then enter his glory  </s>
<s> and beginning with moses and all the prophets  he explained to them what was said in all the scriptures concerning himself </s>
<s> as they approached the village to which they were going  jesus continued on as if he were going further </s>
<s> but they urged him strongly   stay with us  for it is nearly evening  the day is almost over   so he went in to stay with them </s>
<s> when he was at the table with them  he took bread  gave thanks  broke it and began to give it to them </s>
<s> then their eyes were opened and they recognised him  and he disappeared from their sight </s>
<s> they asked each other   were not our hearts burning within us while he talked with us on the road and opened the scriptures to us  </s>
<s> they got up and returned at once to jerusalem  there they found the eleven and those with them  assembled together</s>
<s> and saying   it is true  the lord has risen and has appeared to simon  </s>
<s> then the two told what had happened on the way  and how jesus was recognised by them when he broke the bread </s>
<s> while they were still talking about this  jesus himself stood among them and said to them   peace be with you  </s>
<s> they were startled and frightened  thinking they saw a ghost </s>
<s> he said to them   why are you troubled  and why do doubts rise in your minds </s>
<s> look at my hands and my feet  it is i myself  touch me and see  a ghost does not have flesh and bones  as you see i have  </s>
<s> when he had said this  he showed them his hands and feet </s>
<s> and while they still did not believe it because of joy and amazement  he asked them   do you have anything here to eat  </s>
<s> they gave him a piece of broiled fish </s>
<s> and he took it and ate it in their presence </s>
<s> he said to them   this is what i told you while i was still with you  everything must be fulfilled that is written about me in the law of moses  the prophets and the psalms  </s>
<s> then he opened their minds so they could understand the scriptures </s>
<s> he told them   this is what is written  the messiah will suffer and rise from the dead on the third day </s>
<s> and repentance for the forgiveness of sins will be preached in his name to all nations  beginning at jerusalem </s>
<s> you are witnesses of these things </s>
<s> i am going to send you what my father has promised  but stay in the city until you have been clothed with power from on high  </s>
<s> when he had led them out to the vicinity of bethany  he lifted up his hands and blessed them </s>
<s> while he was blessing them  he left them and was taken up into heaven </s>
<s> then they worshipped him and returned to jerusalem with great joy </s>
<s> and they stayed continually at the temple  praising god </s>
<s> in the beginning was the word  and the word was with god  and the word was god </s>
<s> he was with god in the beginning </s>
<s> through him all things were made  without him nothing was made that has been made </s>
<s> in him was life  and that life was the light of all mankind </s>
<s> the light shines in the darkness  and the darkness has not overcome it </s>
<s> there was a man sent from god whose name was john </s>
<s> he came as a witness to testify concerning that light  so that through him all might believe </s>
<s> he himself was not the light  he came only as a witness to the light </s>
<s> the true light that gives light to everyone was coming into the world </s>
<s> he was in the world  and though the world was made through him  the world did not recognise him </s>
<s> he came to that which was his own  but his own did not receive him </s>
<s> yet to all who did receive him  to those who believed in his name  he gave the right to become children of god </s>
<s> children born not of natural descent  nor of human decision or a husbands will  but born of god </s>
<s> the word became flesh and made his dwelling among us  we have seen his glory  the glory of the one and only son  who came from the father  full of grace and truth </s>
<s>  john testified concerning him  he cried out  saying   this is the one i spoke about when i said   he who comes after me has surpassed me because he was before me    </s>
<s> out of his fullness we have all received grace in place of grace already given </s>
<s> for the law was given through moses  grace and truth came through jesus christ </s>
<s> no one has ever seen god  but the one and only son  who is himself god and is in the closest relationship with the father  has made him known </s>
<s> now this was johns testimony when the jewish leaders in jerusalem sent priests and levites to ask him who he was </s>
<s> he did not fail to confess  but confessed freely   i am not the messiah  </s>
<s> they asked him   then who are you  are you elijah   he said   i am not    are you the prophet   he answered   no  </s>
<s> finally they said   who are you  give us an answer to take back to those who sent us  what do you say about yourself  </s>
<s> john replied in the words of isaiah the prophet   i am the voice of one calling in the wilderness   make straight the way for the lord   </s>
<s> now the pharisees who had been sent</s>
<s> questioned him   why then do you baptise if you are not the messiah  nor elijah  nor the prophet  </s>
<s>  i baptise with water   john replied   but among you stands one you do not know </s>
<s> he is the one who comes after me  the straps of whose sandals i am not worthy to untie  </s>
<s> this all happened at bethany on the other side of the jordan  where john was baptising </s>
<s> the next day john saw jesus coming towards him and said   look  the lamb of god  who takes away the sin of the world </s>
<s> this is the one i meant when i said   a man who comes after me has surpassed me because he was before me  </s>
<s> i myself did not know him  but the reason i came baptising with water was that he might be revealed to israel  </s>
<s> then john gave this testimony   i saw the spirit come down from heaven as a dove and remain on him </s>
<s> and i myself did not know him  but the one who sent me to baptise with water told me   the man on whom you see the spirit come down and remain is the one who will baptise with the holy spirit  </s>
<s> i have seen and i testify that this is gods chosen one  </s>
<s> the next day john was there again with two of his disciples </s>
<s> when he saw jesus passing by  he said   look  the lamb of god  </s>
<s> when the two disciples heard him say this  they followed jesus </s>
<s> turning round  jesus saw them following and asked   what do you want   they said   rabbi  which means  teacher    where are you staying  </s>
<s>  come   he replied   and you will see   so they went and saw where he was staying  and they spent that day with him  it was about four in the afternoon </s>
<s> andrew  simon peters brother  was one of the two who heard what john had said and who had followed jesus </s>
<s> the first thing andrew did was to find his brother simon and tell him   we have found the messiah  that is  the christ  </s>
<s> and he brought him to jesus  jesus looked at him and said   you are simon son of john  you will be called cephas  which  when translated  is peter  </s>
<s> the next day jesus decided to leave for galilee  finding philip  he said to him   follow me  </s>
<s> philip  like andrew and peter  was from the town of bethsaida </s>
<s> philip found nathanael and told him   we have found the one moses wrote about in the law  and about whom the prophets also wrote  jesus of nazareth  the son of joseph  </s>
<s>  nazareth  can anything good come from there   nathanael asked   come and see   said philip </s>
<s> when jesus saw nathanael approaching  he said of him   here truly is an israelite in whom there is no deceit  </s>
<s>  how do you know me   nathanael asked  jesus answered   i saw you while you were still under the figtree before philip called you  </s>
<s> then nathanael declared   rabbi  you are the son of god  you are the king of israel  </s>
<s> jesus said   you believe because i told you i saw you under the figtree  you will see greater things than that  </s>
<s> he then added   very truly i tell you  you will see  heaven open  and the angels of god ascending and descending on  the son of man  </s>
<s> on the third day a wedding took place at cana in galilee  jesus mother was there </s>
<s> and jesus and his disciples had also been invited to the wedding </s>
<s> when the wine was gone  jesus mother said to him   they have no more wine  </s>
<s>  woman  why do you involve me   jesus replied   my hour has not yet come  </s>
<s> his mother said to the servants   do whatever he tells you  </s>
<s> nearby stood six stone water jars  the kind used by the jews for ceremonial washing  each holding from eighty to a hundred and twenty litres </s>
<s> jesus said to the servants   fill the jars with water  so they filled them to the brim </s>
<s> then he told them   now draw some out and take it to the master of the banquet   they did so </s>
<s> and the master of the banquet tasted the water that had been turned into wine  he did not realise where it had come from  though the servants who had drawn the water knew  then he called the bridegroom aside</s>
<s> and said   everyone brings out the choice wine first and then the cheaper wine after the guests have had too much to drink  but you have saved the best till now  </s>
<s> what jesus did here in cana of galilee was the first of the signs through which he revealed his glory  and his disciples believed in him </s>
<s> after this he went down to capernaum with his mother and brothers and his disciples  there they stayed for a few days </s>
<s> when it was almost time for the jewish passover  jesus went up to jerusalem </s>
<s> in the temple courts he found people selling cattle  sheep and doves  and others sitting at tables exchanging money </s>
<s> so he made a whip out of cords  and drove all from the temple courts  both sheep and cattle  he scattered the coins of the moneychangers and overturned their tables </s>
<s> to those who sold doves he said   get these out of here  stop turning my fathers house into a market  </s>
<s> his disciples remembered that it is written   zeal for your house will consume me  </s>
<s> the jews then responded to him   what sign can you show us to prove your authority to do all this  </s>
<s> jesus answered them   destroy this temple  and i will raise it again in three days  </s>
<s> they replied   it has taken fortysix years to build this temple  and you are going to raise it in three days  </s>
<s> but the temple he had spoken of was his body </s>
<s> after he was raised from the dead  his disciples recalled what he had said  then they believed the scripture and the words that jesus had spoken </s>
<s> now while he was in jerusalem at the passover festival  many people saw the signs he was performing and believed in his name </s>
<s> but jesus would not entrust himself to them  for he knew all people </s>
<s> he did not need any testimony about mankind  for he knew what was in each person </s>
<s> now there was a pharisee  a man named nicodemus who was a member of the jewish ruling council </s>
<s> he came to jesus at night and said   rabbi  we know that you are a teacher who has come from god  for no one could perform the signs you are doing if god were not with him  </s>
<s> jesus replied   very truly i tell you  no one can see the kingdom of god unless they are born again  </s>
<s>  how can someone be born when they are old   nicodemus asked   surely they cannot enter a second time into their mothers womb to be born  </s>
<s> jesus answered   very truly i tell you  no one can enter the kingdom of god unless they are born of water and the spirit </s>
<s> flesh gives birth to flesh  but the spirit gives birth to spirit </s>
<s> you should not be surprised at my saying   you must be born again  </s>
<s> the wind blows wherever it pleases  you hear its sound  but you cannot tell where it comes from or where it is going  so it is with everyone born of the spirit  </s>
<s>  how can this be   nicodemus asked </s>
<s>  you are israels teacher   said jesus   and do you not understand these things </s>
<s> very truly i tell you  we speak of what we know  and we testify to what we have seen  but still you people do not accept our testimony </s>
<s> i have spoken to you of earthly things and you do not believe  how then will you believe if i speak of heavenly things </s>
<s> no one has ever gone into heaven except the one who came from heaven  the son of man </s>
<s> just as moses lifted up the snake in the wilderness  so the son of man must be lifted up </s>
<s> that everyone who believes may have eternal life in him  </s>
<s> for god so loved the world that he gave his one and only son  that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life </s>
<s> for god did not send his son into the world to condemn the world  but to save the world through him </s>
<s> whoever believes in him is not condemned  but whoever does not believe stands condemned already because they have not believed in the name of gods one and only son </s>
<s> this is the verdict  light has come into the world  but people loved darkness instead of light because their deeds were evil </s>
<s> everyone who does evil hates the light  and will not come into the light for fear that their deeds will be exposed </s>
<s> but whoever lives by the truth comes into the light  so that it may be seen plainly that what they have done has been done in the sight of god </s>
<s> after this  jesus and his disciples went out into the judean countryside  where he spent some time with them  and baptised </s>
<s> now john also was baptising at aenon near salim  because there was plenty of water  and people were coming and being baptised </s>
<s>  this was before john was put in prison  </s>
<s> an argument developed between some of johns disciples and a certain jew over the matter of ceremonial washing </s>
<s> they came to john and said to him   rabbi  that man who was with you on the other side of the jordan  the one you testified about  look  he is baptising  and everyone is going to him  </s>
<s> to this john replied   a person can receive only what is given them from heaven </s>
<s> you yourselves can testify that i said   i am not the messiah but am sent ahead of him  </s>
<s> the bride belongs to the bridegroom  the friend who attends the bridegroom waits and listens for him  and is full of joy when he hears the bridegrooms voice  that joy is mine  and it is now complete </s>
<s> he must become greater  i must become less  </s>
<s> the one who comes from above is above all  the one who is from the earth belongs to the earth  and speaks as one from the earth  the one who comes from heaven is above all </s>
<s> he testifies to what he has seen and heard  but no one accepts his testimony </s>
<s> whoever has accepted it has certified that god is truthful </s>
<s> for the one whom god has sent speaks the words of god  for god gives the spirit without limit </s>
<s> the father loves the son and has placed everything in his hands </s>
<s> whoever believes in the son has eternal life  but whoever rejects the son will not see life  for gods wrath remains on them </s>
<s> now jesus learned that the pharisees had heard that he was gaining and baptising more disciples than john </s>
<s> although in fact it was not jesus who baptised  but his disciples </s>
<s> so he left judea and went back once more to galilee </s>
<s> now he had to go through samaria </s>
<s> so he came to a town in samaria called sychar  near the plot of ground jacob had given to his son joseph </s>
<s> jacobs well was there  and jesus  tired as he was from the journey  sat down by the well  it was about noon </s>
<s> when a samaritan woman came to draw water  jesus said to her   will you give me a drink  </s>
<s>  his disciples had gone into the town to buy food  </s>
<s> the samaritan woman said to him   you are a jew and i am a samaritan woman  how can you ask me for a drink    for jews do not associate with samaritans  </s>
<s> jesus answered her   if you knew the gift of god and who it is that asks you for a drink  you would have asked him and he would have given you living water  </s>
<s>  sir   the woman said   you have nothing to draw with and the well is deep  where can you get this living water </s>
<s> are you greater than our father jacob  who gave us the well and drank from it himself  as did also his sons and his livestock  </s>
<s> jesus answered   everyone who drinks this water will be thirsty again </s>
<s> but whoever drinks the water i give them will never thirst  indeed  the water i give them will become in them a spring of water welling up to eternal life  </s>
<s> the woman said to him   sir  give me this water so that i wont get thirsty and have to keep coming here to draw water  </s>
<s> he told her   go  call your husband and come back  </s>
<s>  i have no husband   she replied  jesus said to her   you are right when you say you have no husband </s>
<s> the fact is  you have had five husbands  and the man you now have is not your husband  what you have just said is quite true  </s>
<s>  sir   the woman said   i can see that you are a prophet </s>
<s> our ancestors worshipped on this mountain  but you jews claim that the place where we must worship is in jerusalem  </s>
<s>  woman   jesus replied   believe me  a time is coming when you will worship the father neither on this mountain nor in jerusalem </s>
<s> you samaritans worship what you do not know  we worship what we do know  for salvation is from the jews </s>
<s> yet a time is coming and has now come when the true worshippers will worship the father in the spirit and in truth  for they are the kind of worshippers the father seeks </s>
<s> god is spirit  and his worshippers must worship in the spirit and in truth  </s>
<s> the woman said   i know that messiah  called christ   is coming  when he comes  he will explain everything to us  </s>
<s> then jesus declared   i  the one speaking to you  i am he  </s>
<s> just then his disciples returned and were surprised to find him talking with a woman  but no one asked   what do you want   or  why are you talking with her  </s>
<s> then  leaving her water jar  the woman went back to the town and said to the people </s>
<s>  come  see a man who told me everything ive ever done  could this be the messiah  </s>
<s> they came out of the town and made their way towards him </s>
<s> meanwhile his disciples urged him   rabbi  eat something  </s>
<s> but he said to them   i have food to eat that you know nothing about  </s>
<s> then his disciples said to each other   could someone have brought him food  </s>
<s>  my food   said jesus   is to do the will of him who sent me and to finish his work </s>
<s> dont you have a saying   its still four months until harvest   i tell you  open your eyes and look at the fields  they are ripe for harvest </s>
<s> even now the one who reaps draws a wage and harvests a crop for eternal life  so that the sower and the reaper may be glad together </s>
<s> thus the saying  one sows and another reaps  is true </s>
<s> i sent you to reap what you have not worked for  others have done the hard work  and you have reaped the benefits of their labour  </s>
<s> many of the samaritans from that town believed in him because of the womans testimony   he told me everything ive ever done  </s>
<s> so when the samaritans came to him  they urged him to stay with them  and he stayed two days </s>
<s> and because of his words many more became believers </s>
<s> they said to the woman   we no longer believe just because of what you said  now we have heard for ourselves  and we know that this man really is the saviour of the world  </s>
<s> after the two days he left for galilee </s>
<s>  now jesus himself had pointed out that a prophet has no honour in his own country  </s>
<s> when he arrived in galilee  the galileans welcomed him  they had seen all that he had done in jerusalem at the passover festival  for they also had been there </s>
<s> once more he visited cana in galilee  where he had turned the water into wine  and there was a certain royal official whose son lay ill at capernaum </s>
<s> when this man heard that jesus had arrived in galilee from judea  he went to him and begged him to come and heal his son  who was close to death </s>
<s>  unless you people see signs and wonders   jesus told him   you will never believe  </s>
<s> the royal official said   sir  come down before my child dies  </s>
<s>  go   jesus replied   your son will live   the man took jesus at his word and departed </s>
<s> while he was still on the way  his servants met him with the news that his boy was living </s>
<s> when he enquired as to the time when his son got better  they said to him   yesterday  at one in the afternoon  the fever left him  </s>
<s> then the father realised that this was the exact time at which jesus had said to him   your son will live   so he and his whole household believed </s>
<s> this was the second sign jesus performed after coming from judea to galilee </s>
<s> some time later  jesus went up to jerusalem for one of the jewish festivals </s>
<s> now there is in jerusalem near the sheep gate a pool  which in aramaic is called bethesda and which is surrounded by five covered colonnades </s>
<s> here a great number of disabled people used to lie  the blind  the lame  the paralysed  </s>
<s> </s>
<s> one who was there had been an invalid for thirtyeight years </s>
<s> when jesus saw him lying there and learned that he had been in this condition for a long time  he asked him   do you want to get well  </s>
<s>  sir   the invalid replied   i have no one to help me into the pool when the water is stirred  while i am trying to get in  someone else goes down ahead of me  </s>
<s> then jesus said to him   get up  pick up your mat and walk  </s>
<s> at once the man was cured  he picked up his mat and walked  the day on which this took place was a sabbath </s>
<s> and so the jewish leaders said to the man who had been healed   it is the sabbath  the law forbids you to carry your mat  </s>
<s> but he replied   the man who made me well said to me   pick up your mat and walk   </s>
<s> so they asked him   who is this fellow who told you to pick it up and walk  </s>
<s> the man who was healed had no idea who it was  for jesus had slipped away into the crowd that was there </s>
<s> later jesus found him at the temple and said to him   see  you are well again  stop sinning or something worse may happen to you  </s>
<s> the man went away and told the jewish leaders that it was jesus who had made him well </s>
<s> so  because jesus was doing these things on the sabbath  the jewish leaders began to persecute him </s>
<s> in his defence jesus said to them   my father is always at his work to this very day  and i too am working  </s>
<s> for this reason they tried all the more to kill him  not only was he breaking the sabbath  but he was even calling god his own father  making himself equal with god </s>
<s> jesus gave them this answer   very truly i tell you  the son can do nothing by himself  he can do only what he sees his father doing  because whatever the father does the son also does </s>
<s> for the father loves the son and shows him all he does  yes  and he will show him even greater works than these  so that you will be amazed </s>
<s> for just as the father raises the dead and gives them life  even so the son gives life to whom he is pleased to give it </s>
<s> moreover  the father judges no one  but has entrusted all judgment to the son </s>
<s> that all may honour the son just as they honour the father  whoever does not honour the son does not honour the father  who sent him </s>
<s>  very truly i tell you  whoever hears my word and believes him who sent me has eternal life and will not be judged but has crossed over from death to life </s>
<s> very truly i tell you  a time is coming and has now come when the dead will hear the voice of the son of god and those who hear will live </s>
<s> for as the father has life in himself  so he has granted the son also to have life in himself </s>
<s> and he has given him authority to judge because he is the son of man </s>

<s>  you have sent to john and he has testified to the truth </s>
<s> not that i accept human testimony  but i mention it that you may be saved </s>
<s> john was a lamp that burned and gave light  and you chose for a time to enjoy his light </s>
<s>  i have testimony weightier than that of john  for the works that the father has given me to finish  the very works that i am doing  testify that the father has sent me </s>
<s> and the father who sent me has himself testified concerning me  you have never heard his voice nor seen his form </s>
<s> nor does his word dwell in you  for you do not believe the one he sent </s>
<s> you study the scriptures diligently because you think that in them you have eternal life  these are the very scriptures that testify about me </s>

<s>  i do not accept glory from human beings </s>
<s> but i know you  i know that you do not have the love of god in your hearts </s>
<s> i have come in my fathers name  and you do not accept me  but if someone else comes in his own name  you will accept him </s>
<s> how can you believe since you accept glory from one another but do not seek the glory that comes from the only god </s>
<s>  but do not think i will accuse you before the father  your accuser is moses  on whom your hopes are set </s>

<s> some time after this  jesus crossed to the far shore of the sea of galilee  that is  the sea of tiberias  </s>
<s> and a great crowd of people followed him because they saw the signs he had performed by healing those who were ill </s>
<s> then jesus went up on a mountainside and sat down with his disciples </s>
<s> the jewish passover festival was near </s>
<s> when jesus looked up and saw a great crowd coming towards him  he said to philip   where shall we buy bread for these people to eat  </s>
<s> he asked this only to test him  for he already had in mind what he was going to do </s>
<s> philip answered him   it would take more than half a years wages to buy enough bread for each one to have a bite  </s>
<s> another of his disciples  andrew  simon peters brother  spoke up </s>
<s>  here is a boy with five small barley loaves and two small fish  but how far will they go among so many  </s>
<s> jesus said   make the people sit down   there was plenty of grass in that place  and they sat down  about five thousand men were there  </s>
<s> jesus then took the loaves  gave thanks  and distributed to those who were seated as much as they wanted  he did the same with the fish </s>
<s> when they had all had enough to eat  he said to his disciples   gather the pieces that are left over  let nothing be wasted  </s>
<s> so they gathered them and filled twelve baskets with the pieces of the five barley loaves left over by those who had eaten </s>
<s> after the people saw the sign jesus performed  they began to say   surely this is the prophet who is to come into the world  </s>
<s> jesus  knowing that they intended to come and make him king by force  withdrew again to a mountain by himself </s>
<s> when evening came  his disciples went down to the lake </s>
<s> where they got into a boat and set off across the lake for capernaum  by now it was dark  and jesus had not yet joined them </s>
<s> a strong wind was blowing and the waters grew rough </s>
<s> when they had rowed about three or four miles  they saw jesus approaching the boat  walking on the water  and they were frightened </s>
<s> but he said to them   it is i  dont be afraid  </s>
<s> then they were willing to take him into the boat  and immediately the boat reached the shore where they were heading </s>
<s> the next day the crowd that had stayed on the opposite shore of the lake realised that only one boat had been there  and that jesus had not entered it with his disciples  but that they had gone away alone </s>
<s> then some boats from tiberias landed near the place where the people had eaten the bread after the lord had given thanks </s>
<s> once the crowd realised that neither jesus nor his disciples were there  they got into the boats and went to capernaum in search of jesus </s>
<s> when they found him on the other side of the lake  they asked him   rabbi  when did you get here  </s>
<s> jesus answered   very truly i tell you  you are looking for me  not because you saw the signs i performed but because you ate the loaves and had your fill </s>
<s> do not work for food that spoils  but for food that endures to eternal life  which the son of man will give you  for on him god the father has placed his seal of approval  </s>
<s> then they asked him   what must we do to do the works god requires  </s>
<s> jesus answered   the work of god is this  to believe in the one he has sent  </s>
<s> so they asked him   what sign then will you give that we may see it and believe you  what will you do </s>
<s> our ancestors ate the manna in the wilderness  as it is written   he gave them bread from heaven to eat   </s>
<s> jesus said to them   very truly i tell you  it is not moses who has given you the bread from heaven  but it is my father who gives you the true bread from heaven </s>
<s> for the bread of god is the bread that comes down from heaven and gives life to the world  </s>
<s>  sir   they said   always give us this bread  </s>
<s> then jesus declared   i am the bread of life  whoever comes to me will never go hungry  and whoever believes in me will never be thirsty </s>
<s> but as i told you  you have seen me and still you do not believe </s>
<s> all those the father gives me will come to me  and whoever comes to me i will never drive away </s>
<s> for i have come down from heaven not to do my will but to do the will of him who sent me </s>
<s> and this is the will of him who sent me  that i shall lose none of all those he has given me  but raise them up at the last day </s>
<s> for my fathers will is that everyone who looks to the son and believes in him shall have eternal life  and i will raise them up at the last day  </s>
<s> at this the jews there began to grumble about him because he said   i am the bread that came down from heaven  </s>
<s> they said   is this not jesus  the son of joseph  whose father and mother we know  how can he now say   i came down from heaven   </s>
<s>  stop grumbling among yourselves   jesus answered </s>
<s>  no one can come to me unless the father who sent me draws them  and i will raise them up at the last day </s>
<s> it is written in the prophets   they will all be taught by god   everyone who has heard the father and learned from him comes to me </s>
<s> no one has seen the father except the one who is from god  only he has seen the father </s>
<s> very truly i tell you  the one who believes has eternal life </s>
<s> i am the bread of life </s>
<s> your ancestors ate the manna in the wilderness  yet they died </s>
<s> but here is the bread that comes down from heaven  which anyone may eat and not die </s>
<s> i am the living bread that came down from heaven  whoever eats this bread will live for ever  this bread is my flesh  which i will give for the life of the world  </s>
<s> then the jews began to argue sharply among themselves   how can this man give us his flesh to eat  </s>
<s> jesus said to them   very truly i tell you  unless you eat the flesh of the son of man and drink his blood  you have no life in you </s>
<s> whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life  and i will raise them up at the last day </s>
<s> for my flesh is real food and my blood is real drink </s>
<s> whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood remains in me  and i in them </s>
<s> just as the living father sent me and i live because of the father  so the one who feeds on me will live because of me </s>
<s> this is the bread that came down from heaven  your ancestors ate manna and died  but whoever feeds on this bread will live for ever  </s>
<s> he said this while teaching in the synagogue in capernaum </s>
<s> on hearing it  many of his disciples said   this is a hard teaching  who can accept it  </s>
<s> aware that his disciples were grumbling about this  jesus said to them   does this offend you </s>
<s> then what if you see the son of man ascend to where he was before </s>
<s> the spirit gives life  the flesh counts for nothing  the words i have spoken to you  they are full of the spirit and life </s>
<s> yet there are some of you who do not believe   for jesus had known from the beginning which of them did not believe and who would betray him </s>
<s> he went on to say   this is why i told you that no one can come to me unless the father has enabled them  </s>
<s> from this time many of his disciples turned back and no longer followed him </s>
<s>  you do not want to leave too  do you   jesus asked the twelve </s>
<s> simon peter answered him   lord  to whom shall we go  you have the words of eternal life </s>
<s> we have come to believe and to know that you are the holy one of god  </s>
<s> then jesus replied   have i not chosen you  the twelve  yet one of you is a devil  </s>
<s>  he meant judas  the son of simon iscariot  who  though one of the twelve  was later to betray him  </s>
<s> after this  jesus went around in galilee  he did not want to go about in judea because the jewish leaders there were looking for a way to kill him </s>
<s> but when the jewish festival of tabernacles was near </s>
<s> jesus brothers said to him   leave galilee and go to judea  so that your disciples there may see the works you do </s>
<s> no one who wants to become a public figure acts in secret  since you are doing these things  show yourself to the world  </s>
<s> for even his own brothers did not believe in him </s>
<s> therefore jesus told them   my time is not yet here  for you any time will do </s>
<s> the world cannot hate you  but it hates me because i testify that its works are evil </s>
<s> you go to the festival  i am not going up to this festival  because my time has not yet fully come  </s>
<s> after he had said this  he stayed in galilee </s>
<s> however  after his brothers had left for the festival  he went also  not publicly  but in secret </s>
<s> now at the festival the jewish leaders were watching for jesus and asking   where is he  </s>
<s> among the crowds there was widespread whispering about him  some said   he is a good man   others replied   no  he deceives the people  </s>
<s> but no one would say anything publicly about him for fear of the leaders </s>
<s> not until halfway through the festival did jesus go up to the temple courts and begin to teach </s>
<s> the jews there were amazed and asked   how did this man get such learning without having been taught  </s>
<s> jesus answered   my teaching is not my own  it comes from the one who sent me </s>
<s> anyone who chooses to do the will of god will find out whether my teaching comes from god or whether i speak on my own </s>
<s> whoever speaks on their own does so to gain personal glory  but he who seeks the glory of the one who sent him is a man of truth  there is nothing false about him </s>
<s> has not moses given you the law  yet not one of you keeps the law  why are you trying to kill me  </s>
<s>  you are demonpossessed   the crowd answered   who is trying to kill you  </s>
<s> jesus said to them   i did one miracle  and you are all amazed </s>
<s> yet  because moses gave you circumcision  though actually it did not come from moses  but from the patriarchs   you circumcise a boy on the sabbath </s>
<s> now if a boy can be circumcised on the sabbath so that the law of moses may not be broken  why are you angry with me for healing a mans whole body on the sabbath </s>
<s> stop judging by mere appearances  but instead judge correctly  </s>
<s> at that point some of the people of jerusalem began to ask   isnt this the man they are trying to kill </s>
<s> here he is  speaking publicly  and they are not saying a word to him  have the authorities really concluded that he is the messiah </s>
<s> but we know where this man is from  when the messiah comes  no one will know where he is from  </s>
<s> then jesus  still teaching in the temple courts  cried out   yes  you know me  and you know where i am from  i am not here on my own authority  but he who sent me is true  you do not know him </s>
<s> but i know him because i am from him and he sent me  </s>
<s> at this they tried to seize him  but no one laid a hand on him  because his hour had not yet come </s>
<s> still  many in the crowd believed in him  they said   when the messiah comes  will he perform more signs than this man  </s>
<s> the pharisees heard the crowd whispering such things about him  then the chief priests and the pharisees sent temple guards to arrest him </s>
<s> jesus said   i am with you for only a short time  and then i am going to the one who sent me </s>
<s> you will look for me  but you will not find me  and where i am  you cannot come  </s>
<s> the jews said to one another   where does this man intend to go that we cannot find him  will he go where our people live scattered among the greeks  and teach the greeks </s>
<s> what did he mean when he said   you will look for me  but you will not find me   and  where i am  you cannot come   </s>
<s> on the last and greatest day of the festival  jesus stood and said in a loud voice   let anyone who is thirsty come to me and drink </s>
<s> whoever believes in me  as scripture has said  rivers of living water will flow from within them  </s>
<s> by this he meant the spirit  whom those who believed in him were later to receive  up to that time the spirit had not been given  since jesus had not yet been glorified </s>
<s> on hearing his words  some of the people said   surely this man is the prophet  </s>
<s> others said   he is the messiah   still others asked   how can the messiah come from galilee </s>
<s> does not scripture say that the messiah will come from davids descendants and from bethlehem  the town where david lived  </s>
<s> thus the people were divided because of jesus </s>
<s> some wanted to seize him  but no one laid a hand on him </s>
<s> finally the temple guards went back to the chief priests and the pharisees  who asked them   why didnt you bring him in  </s>
<s>  no one ever spoke the way this man does   the guards replied </s>
<s>  you mean he has deceived you also   the pharisees retorted </s>
<s>  have any of the rulers or of the pharisees believed in him </s>
<s> no  but this mob that knows nothing of the law  there is a curse on them  </s>
<s> nicodemus  who had gone to jesus earlier and who was one of their own number  asked </s>
<s>  does our law condemn a man without first hearing him to find out what he has been doing  </s>
<s> they replied   are you from galilee  too  look into it  and you will find that a prophet does not come out of galilee  </s>
<s> then they all went home </s>
<s> but jesus went to the mount of olives </s>
<s> at dawn he appeared again in the temple courts  where all the people gathered round him  and he sat down to teach them </s>
<s> the teachers of the law and the pharisees brought in a woman caught in adultery  they made her stand before the group</s>
<s> and said to jesus   teacher  this woman was caught in the act of adultery </s>
<s> in the law moses commanded us to stone such women  now what do you say  </s>
<s> they were using this question as a trap  in order to have a basis for accusing him  but jesus bent down and started to write on the ground with his finger </s>
<s> when they kept on questioning him  he straightened up and said to them   let any one of you who is without sin be the first to throw a stone at her  </s>
<s> again he stooped down and wrote on the ground </s>
<s> at this  those who heard began to go away one at a time  the older ones first  until only jesus was left  with the woman still standing there </s>
<s> jesus straightened up and asked her   woman  where are they  has no one condemned you  </s>
<s>  no one  sir   she said   then neither do i condemn you   jesus declared   go now and leave your life of sin  </s>
<s> when jesus spoke again to the people  he said   i am the light of the world  whoever follows me will never walk in darkness  but will have the light of life  </s>
<s> the pharisees challenged him   here you are  appearing as your own witness  your testimony is not valid  </s>
<s> jesus answered   even if i testify on my own behalf  my testimony is valid  for i know where i came from and where i am going  but you have no idea where i come from or where i am going </s>
<s> you judge by human standards  i pass judgment on no one </s>
<s> but if i do judge  my decisions are true  because i am not alone  i stand with the father  who sent me </s>
<s> in your own law it is written that the testimony of two witnesses is true </s>
<s> i am one who testifies for myself  my other witness is the father  who sent me  </s>
<s> then they asked him   where is your father    you do not know me or my father   jesus replied   if you knew me  you would know my father also  </s>
<s> he spoke these words while teaching in the temple courts near the place where the offerings were put  yet no one seized him  because his hour had not yet come </s>
<s> once more jesus said to them   i am going away  and you will look for me  and you will die in your sin  where i go  you cannot come  </s>
<s> this made the jews ask   will he kill himself  is that why he says   where i go  you cannot come   </s>
<s> but he continued   you are from below  i am from above  you are of this world  i am not of this world </s>
<s> i told you that you would die in your sins  if you do not believe that i am he  you will indeed die in your sins  </s>
<s>  who are you   they asked   just what i have been telling you from the beginning   jesus replied </s>
<s>  i have much to say in judgment of you  but he who sent me is trustworthy  and what i have heard from him i tell the world  </s>
<s> they did not understand that he was telling them about his father </s>
<s> so jesus said   when you have lifted up the son of man  then you will know that i am he and that i do nothing on my own but speak just what the father has taught me </s>
<s> the one who sent me is with me  he has not left me alone  for i always do what pleases him  </s>
<s> even as he spoke  many believed in him </s>
<s> to the jews who had believed him  jesus said   if you hold to my teaching  you are really my disciples </s>
<s> then you will know the truth  and the truth will set you free  </s>
<s> they answered him   we are abrahams descendants and have never been slaves of anyone  how can you say that we shall be set free  </s>
<s> jesus replied   very truly i tell you  everyone who sins is a slave to sin </s>
<s> now a slave has no permanent place in the family  but a son belongs to it for ever </s>
<s> so if the son sets you free  you will be free indeed </s>
<s> i know you are abrahams descendants  yet you are looking for a way to kill me  because you have no room for my word </s>
<s> i am telling you what i have seen in the fathers presence  and you are doing what you have heard from your father  </s>
<s>  abraham is our father   they answered   if you were abrahams children   said jesus   then you would do what abraham did </s>
<s> as it is  you are looking for a way to kill me  a man who has told you the truth that i heard from god  abraham did not do such things </s>
<s> you are doing the works of your own father    we are not illegitimate children   they protested   the only father we have is god himself  </s>
<s> jesus said to them   if god were your father  you would love me  for i have come here from god  i have not come on my own  god sent me </s>
<s> why is my language not clear to you  because you are unable to hear what i say </s>
<s> you belong to your father  the devil  and you want to carry out your fathers desires  he was a murderer from the beginning  not holding to the truth  for there is no truth in him  when he lies  he speaks his native language  for he is a liar and the father of lies </s>
<s> yet because i tell the truth  you do not believe me </s>
<s> can any of you prove me guilty of sin  if i am telling the truth  why dont you believe me </s>
<s> whoever belongs to god hears what god says  the reason you do not hear is that you do not belong to god  </s>
<s> the jews answered him   arent we right in saying that you are a samaritan and demonpossessed  </s>
<s>  i am not possessed by a demon   said jesus   but i honour my father and you dishonour me </s>
<s> i am not seeking glory for myself  but there is one who seeks it  and he is the judge </s>
<s> very truly i tell you  whoever obeys my word will never see death  </s>
<s> at this they exclaimed   now we know that you are demonpossessed  abraham died and so did the prophets  yet you say that whoever obeys your word will never taste death </s>
<s> are you greater than our father abraham  he died  and so did the prophets  who do you think you are  </s>
<s> jesus replied   if i glorify myself  my glory means nothing  my father  whom you claim as your god  is the one who glorifies me </s>
<s> though you do not know him  i know him  if i said i did not  i would be a liar like you  but i do know him and obey his word </s>
<s> your father abraham rejoiced at the thought of seeing my day  he saw it and was glad  </s>
<s>  you are not yet fifty years old   they said to him   and you have seen abraham  </s>
<s>  very truly i tell you   jesus answered   before abraham was born  i am  </s>
<s> at this  they picked up stones to stone him  but jesus hid himself  slipping away from the temple grounds </s>
<s> as he went along  he saw a man blind from birth </s>
<s> his disciples asked him   rabbi  who sinned  this man or his parents  that he was born blind  </s>
<s>  neither this man nor his parents sinned   said jesus   but this happened so that the works of god might be displayed in him </s>
<s> as long as it is day  we must do the works of him who sent me  night is coming  when no one can work </s>
<s> while i am in the world  i am the light of the world  </s>
<s> after saying this  he spat on the ground  made some mud with the saliva  and put it on the mans eyes </s>
<s>  go   he told him   wash in the pool of siloam  this word means  sent   so the man went and washed  and came home seeing </s>
<s> his neighbours and those who had formerly seen him begging asked   isnt this the same man who used to sit and beg  </s>
<s> some claimed that he was  others said   no  he only looks like him   but he himself insisted   i am the man  </s>
<s>  how then were your eyes opened   they asked </s>
<s> he replied   the man they call jesus made some mud and put it on my eyes  he told me to go to siloam and wash  so i went and washed  and then i could see  </s>
<s>  where is this man   they asked him   i dont know   he said </s>
<s> they brought to the pharisees the man who had been blind </s>
<s> now the day on which jesus had made the mud and opened the mans eyes was a sabbath </s>
<s> therefore the pharisees also asked him how he had received his sight   he put mud on my eyes   the man replied   and i washed  and now i see  </s>
<s> some of the pharisees said   this man is not from god  for he does not keep the sabbath   but others asked   how can a sinner perform such signs   so they were divided </s>
<s> then they turned again to the blind man   what have you to say about him  it was your eyes he opened   the man replied   he is a prophet  </s>
<s> they still did not believe that he had been blind and had received his sight until they sent for the mans parents </s>
<s>  is this your son   they asked   is this the one you say was born blind  how is it that now he can see  </s>
<s>  we know he is our son   the parents answered   and we know he was born blind </s>
<s> but how he can see now  or who opened his eyes  we dont know  ask him  he is of age  he will speak for himself  </s>
<s> his parents said this because they were afraid of the jewish leaders  who already had decided that anyone who acknowledged that jesus was the messiah would be put out of the synagogue </s>
<s> that was why his parents said   he is of age  ask him  </s>
<s> a second time they summoned the man who had been blind   give glory to god by telling the truth   they said   we know this man is a sinner  </s>
<s> he replied   whether he is a sinner or not  i dont know  one thing i do know  i was blind but now i see  </s>
<s> then they asked him   what did he do to you  how did he open your eyes  </s>
<s> he answered   i have told you already and you did not listen  why do you want to hear it again  do you want to become his disciples too  </s>
<s> then they hurled insults at him and said   you are this fellows disciple  we are disciples of moses </s>
<s> we know that god spoke to moses  but as for this fellow  we dont even know where he comes from  </s>
<s> the man answered   now that is remarkable  you dont know where he comes from  yet he opened my eyes </s>
<s> we know that god does not listen to sinners  he listens to the godly person who does his will </s>
<s> nobody has ever heard of opening the eyes of a man born blind </s>
<s> if this man were not from god  he could do nothing  </s>
<s> to this they replied   you were steeped in sin at birth  how dare you lecture us   and they threw him out </s>
<s> jesus heard that they had thrown him out  and when he found him  he said   do you believe in the son of man  </s>
<s>  who is he  sir   the man asked   tell me so that i may believe in him  </s>
<s> jesus said   you have now seen him  in fact  he is the one speaking with you  </s>
<s> then the man said   lord  i believe   and he worshipped him </s>
<s> jesus said   for judgment i have come into this world  so that the blind will see and those who see will become blind  </s>
<s> some pharisees who were with him heard him say this and asked   what  are we blind too  </s>
<s> jesus said   if you were blind  you would not be guilty of sin  but now that you claim you can see  your guilt remains </s>
<s>  very truly i tell you pharisees  anyone who does not enter the sheepfold by the gate  but climbs in by some other way  is a thief and a robber </s>
<s> the one who enters by the gate is the shepherd of the sheep </s>
<s> the gatekeeper opens the gate for him  and the sheep listen to his voice  he calls his own sheep by name and leads them out </s>
<s> when he has brought out all his own  he goes on ahead of them  and his sheep follow him because they know his voice </s>
<s> but they will never follow a stranger  in fact  they will run away from him because they do not recognise a strangers voice  </s>
<s> jesus used this figure of speech  but the pharisees did not understand what he was telling them </s>
<s> therefore jesus said again   very truly i tell you  i am the gate for the sheep </s>
<s> all who have come before me are thieves and robbers  but the sheep have not listened to them </s>
<s> i am the gate  whoever enters through me will be saved  they will come in and go out  and find pasture </s>
<s> the thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy  i have come that they may have life  and have it to the full </s>
<s>  i am the good shepherd  the good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep </s>
<s> the hired hand is not the shepherd and does not own the sheep  so when he sees the wolf coming  he abandons the sheep and runs away  then the wolf attacks the flock and scatters it </s>
<s> the man runs away because he is a hired hand and cares nothing for the sheep </s>
<s>  i am the good shepherd  i know my sheep and my sheep know me </s>
<s> just as the father knows me and i know the father  and i lay down my life for the sheep </s>
<s> i have other sheep that are not of this sheepfold  i must bring them also  they too will listen to my voice  and there shall be one flock and one shepherd </s>
<s> the reason my father loves me is that i lay down my life  only to take it up again </s>
<s> no one takes it from me  but i lay it down of my own accord  i have authority to lay it down and authority to take it up again  this command i received from my father  </s>
<s> the jews who heard these words were again divided </s>
<s> many of them said   he is demonpossessed and raving mad  why listen to him  </s>
<s> but others said   these are not the sayings of a man possessed by a demon  can a demon open the eyes of the blind  </s>
<s> then came the festival of dedication at jerusalem  it was winter </s>
<s> and jesus was in the temple courts walking in solomons colonnade </s>
<s> the jews who were there gathered round him  saying   how long will you keep us in suspense  if you are the messiah  tell us plainly  </s>
<s> jesus answered   i did tell you  but you do not believe  the works i do in my fathers name testify about me </s>
<s> but you do not believe because you are not my sheep </s>
<s> my sheep listen to my voice  i know them  and they follow me </s>
<s> i give them eternal life  and they shall never perish  no one will snatch them out of my hand </s>
<s> my father  who has given them to me  is greater than all  no one can snatch them out of my fathers hand </s>
<s> i and the father are one  </s>
<s> again his jewish opponents picked up stones to stone him </s>
<s> but jesus said to them   i have shown you many good works from the father  for which of these do you stone me  </s>
<s>  we are not stoning you for any good work   they replied   but for blasphemy  because you  a mere man  claim to be god  </s>
<s> jesus answered them   is it not written in your law   i have said you are  gods  </s>
<s> if he called them  gods   to whom the word of god came  and scripture cannot be set aside </s>
<s> what about the one whom the father set apart as his very own and sent into the world  why then do you accuse me of blasphemy because i said   i am gods son  </s>
<s> do not believe me unless i do the works of my father </s>
<s> but if i do them  even though you do not believe me  believe the works  that you may know and understand that the father is in me  and i in the father  </s>
<s> again they tried to seize him  but he escaped their grasp </s>
<s> then jesus went back across the jordan to the place where john had been baptising in the early days  there he stayed </s>
<s> and many people came to him  they said   though john never performed a sign  all that john said about this man was true  </s>
<s> and in that place many believed in jesus </s>
<s> now a man named lazarus was ill  he was from bethany  the village of mary and her sister martha </s>
<s>  this mary  whose brother lazarus now lay ill  was the same one who poured perfume on the lord and wiped his feet with her hair  </s>
<s> so the sisters sent word to jesus   lord  the one you love is ill  </s>
<s> when he heard this  jesus said   this illness will not end in death  no  it is for gods glory so that gods son may be glorified through it  </s>
<s> now jesus loved martha and her sister and lazarus </s>
<s> so when he heard that lazarus was ill  he stayed where he was two more days </s>
<s> and then he said to his disciples   let us go back to judea  </s>
<s>  but rabbi   they said   a short while ago the jews there tried to stone you  and yet you are going back  </s>
<s> jesus answered   are there not twelve hours of daylight  anyone who walks in the daytime will not stumble  for they see by this worlds light </s>
<s> it is when a person walks at night that they stumble  for they have no light  </s>
<s> after he had said this  he went on to tell them   our friend lazarus has fallen asleep  but i am going there to wake him up  </s>
<s> his disciples replied   lord  if he sleeps  he will get better  </s>
<s> jesus had been speaking of his death  but his disciples thought he meant natural sleep </s>
<s> so then he told them plainly   lazarus is dead </s>
<s> and for your sake i am glad i was not there  so that you may believe  but let us go to him  </s>
<s> then thomas  also known as didymus  said to the rest of the disciples   let us also go  that we may die with him  </s>
<s> on his arrival  jesus found that lazarus had already been in the tomb for four days </s>
<s> now bethany was less than two miles from jerusalem </s>
<s> and many jews had come to martha and mary to comfort them in the loss of their brother </s>
<s> when martha heard that jesus was coming  she went out to meet him  but mary stayed at home </s>
<s>  lord   martha said to jesus   if you had been here  my brother would not have died </s>
<s> but i know that even now god will give you whatever you ask  </s>
<s> jesus said to her   your brother will rise again  </s>
<s> martha answered   i know he will rise again in the resurrection at the last day  </s>
<s> jesus said to her   i am the resurrection and the life  the one who believes in me will live  even though they die </s>
<s> and whoever lives by believing in me will never die  do you believe this  </s>
<s>  yes  lord   she replied   i believe that you are the messiah  the son of god  who is to come into the world  </s>
<s> after she had said this  she went back and called her sister mary aside   the teacher is here   she said   and is asking for you  </s>
<s> when mary heard this  she got up quickly and went to him </s>
<s> now jesus had not yet entered the village  but was still at the place where martha had met him </s>
<s> when the jews who had been with mary in the house  comforting her  noticed how quickly she got up and went out  they followed her  supposing she was going to the tomb to mourn there </s>
<s> when mary reached the place where jesus was and saw him  she fell at his feet and said   lord  if you had been here  my brother would not have died  </s>
<s> when jesus saw her weeping  and the jews who had come along with her also weeping  he was deeply moved in spirit and troubled </s>
<s>  where have you laid him   he asked   come and see  lord   they replied </s>
<s> jesus wept </s>
<s> then the jews said   see how he loved him  </s>
<s> but some of them said   could not he who opened the eyes of the blind man have kept this man from dying  </s>
<s> jesus  once more deeply moved  came to the tomb  it was a cave with a stone laid across the entrance </s>
<s>  take away the stone   he said   but  lord   said martha  the sister of the dead man   by this time there is a bad odour  for he has been there four days  </s>
<s> then jesus said   did i not tell you that if you believe  you will see the glory of god  </s>
<s> so they took away the stone  then jesus looked up and said   father  i thank you that you have heard me </s>
<s> i knew that you always hear me  but i said this for the benefit of the people standing here  that they may believe that you sent me  </s>
<s> when he had said this  jesus called in a loud voice   lazarus  come out  </s>
<s> the dead man came out  his hands and feet wrapped with strips of linen  and a cloth round his face  jesus said to them   take off the grave clothes and let him go  </s>
<s> therefore many of the jews who had come to visit mary  and had seen what jesus did  believed in him </s>
<s> but some of them went to the pharisees and told them what jesus had done </s>
<s> then the chief priests and the pharisees called a meeting of the sanhedrin   what are we accomplishing   they asked   here is this man performing many signs </s>
<s> if we let him go on like this  everyone will believe in him  and then the romans will come and take away both our temple and our nation  </s>
<s> then one of them  named caiaphas  who was high priest that year  spoke up   you know nothing at all </s>
<s> you do not realise that it is better for you that one man die for the people than that the whole nation perish  </s>
<s> he did not say this on his own  but as high priest that year he prophesied that jesus would die for the jewish nation </s>
<s> and not only for that nation but also for the scattered children of god  to bring them together and make them one </s>
<s> so from that day on they plotted to take his life </s>
<s> therefore jesus no longer moved about publicly among the people of judea  instead he withdrew to a region near the wilderness  to a village called ephraim  where he stayed with his disciples </s>
<s> when it was almost time for the jewish passover  many went up from the country to jerusalem for their ceremonial cleansing before the passover </s>
<s> they kept looking for jesus  and as they stood in the temple courts they asked one another   what do you think  isnt he coming to the festival at all  </s>
<s> but the chief priests and the pharisees had given orders that anyone who found out where jesus was should report it so that they might arrest him </s>
<s> six days before the passover  jesus came to bethany  where lazarus lived  whom jesus had raised from the dead </s>
<s> here a dinner was given in jesus honour  martha served  while lazarus was among those reclining at the table with him </s>
<s> then mary took about half a litre of pure nard  an expensive perfume  she poured it on jesus feet and wiped his feet with her hair  and the house was filled with the fragrance of the perfume </s>
<s> but one of his disciples  judas iscariot  who was later to betray him  objected </s>
<s>  why wasnt this perfume sold and the money given to the poor  it was worth a years wages  </s>
<s> he did not say this because he cared about the poor but because he was a thief  as keeper of the money bag  he used to help himself to what was put into it </s>
<s>  leave her alone   jesus replied   it was intended that she should save this perfume for the day of my burial </s>
<s> you will always have the poor among you  but you will not always have me  </s>
<s> meanwhile a large crowd of jews found out that jesus was there and came  not only because of him but also to see lazarus  whom he had raised from the dead </s>
<s> so the chief priests made plans to kill lazarus as well </s>
<s> for on account of him many of the jews were going over to jesus and believing in him </s>
<s> the next day the great crowd that had come for the festival heard that jesus was on his way to jerusalem </s>
<s> they took palm branches and went out to meet him  shouting   hosanna    blessed is he who comes in the name of the lord    blessed is the king of israel  </s>
<s>  do not be afraid  daughter zion  see  your king is coming  seated on a donkeys colt  </s>
<s> at first his disciples did not understand all this  only after jesus was glorified did they realise that these things had been written about him and that these things had been done to him </s>
<s> now the crowd that was with him when he called lazarus from the tomb and raised him from the dead continued to spread the word </s>
<s> many people  because they had heard that he had performed this sign  went out to meet him </s>
<s> so the pharisees said to one another   see  this is getting us nowhere  look how the whole world has gone after him  </s>
<s> now there were some greeks among those who went up to worship at the festival </s>
<s> they came to philip  who was from bethsaida in galilee  with a request   sir   they said   we would like to see jesus  </s>
<s> philip went to tell andrew  andrew and philip in turn told jesus </s>
<s> jesus replied   the hour has come for the son of man to be glorified </s>
<s> very truly i tell you  unless a grain of wheat falls to the ground and dies  it remains only a single seed  but if it dies  it produces many seeds </s>
<s> anyone who loves their life will lose it  while anyone who hates their life in this world will keep it for eternal life </s>
<s> whoever serves me must follow me  and where i am  my servant also will be  my father will honour the one who serves me </s>
<s>  now my soul is troubled  and what shall i say   father  save me from this hour   no  it was for this very reason i came to this hour </s>
<s> father  glorify your name   then a voice came from heaven   i have glorified it  and will glorify it again  </s>
<s> the crowd that was there and heard it said it had thundered  others said an angel had spoken to him </s>
<s> jesus said   this voice was for your benefit  not mine </s>
<s> now is the time for judgment on this world  now the prince of this world will be driven out </s>
<s> and i  when i am lifted up from the earth  will draw all people to myself  </s>
<s> he said this to show the kind of death he was going to die </s>
<s> the crowd spoke up   we have heard from the law that the messiah will remain for ever  so how can you say   the son of man must be lifted up   who is this  son of man   </s>
<s> then jesus told them   you are going to have the light just a little while longer  walk while you have the light  before darkness overtakes you  whoever walks in the dark does not know where they are going </s>
<s> believe in the light while you have the light  so that you may become children of light   when he had finished speaking  jesus left and hid himself from them </s>
<s> even after jesus had performed so many signs in their presence  they still would not believe in him </s>
<s> this was to fulfil the word of isaiah the prophet   lord  who has believed our message and to whom has the arm of the lord been revealed  </s>
<s> for this reason they could not believe  because  as isaiah says elsewhere </s>
<s>  he has blinded their eyes and hardened their hearts  so they can neither see with their eyes  nor understand with their hearts  nor turn  and i would heal them  </s>
<s> yet at the same time many even among the leaders believed in him  but because of the pharisees they would not openly acknowledge their faith for fear they would be put out of the synagogue </s>
<s> for they loved human praise more than praise from god </s>
<s> then jesus cried out   whoever believes in me does not believe in me only  but in the one who sent me </s>
<s> the one who looks at me is seeing the one who sent me </s>
<s> i have come into the world as a light  so that no one who believes in me should stay in darkness </s>
<s>  if anyone hears my words but does not keep them  i do not judge that person  for i did not come to judge the world  but to save the world </s>
<s> there is a judge for the one who rejects me and does not accept my words  the very words i have spoken will condemn them at the last day </s>
<s> for i did not speak on my own  but the father who sent me commanded me to say all that i have spoken </s>
<s> i know that his command leads to eternal life  so whatever i say is just what the father has told me to say  </s>
<s> it was just before the passover festival  jesus knew that the hour had come for him to leave this world and go to the father  having loved his own who were in the world  he loved them to the end </s>
<s> the evening meal was in progress  and the devil had already prompted judas  the son of simon iscariot  to betray jesus </s>
<s> jesus knew that the father had put all things under his power  and that he had come from god and was returning to god </s>
<s> so he got up from the meal  took off his outer clothing  and wrapped a towel round his waist </s>
<s> after that  he poured water into a basin and began to wash his disciples feet  drying them with the towel that was wrapped round him </s>
<s> he came to simon peter  who said to him   lord  are you going to wash my feet  </s>
<s> jesus replied   you do not realise now what i am doing  but later you will understand  </s>
<s>  no   said peter   you shall never wash my feet   jesus answered   unless i wash you  you have no part with me  </s>
<s>  then  lord   simon peter replied   not just my feet but my hands and my head as well  </s>
<s> jesus answered   those who have had a bath need only to wash their feet  their whole body is clean  and you are clean  though not every one of you  </s>
<s> for he knew who was going to betray him  and that was why he said not every one was clean </s>
<s> when he had finished washing their feet  he put on his clothes and returned to his place   do you understand what i have done for you   he asked them </s>
<s>  you call me  teacher  and  lord   and rightly so  for that is what i am </s>
<s> now that i  your lord and teacher  have washed your feet  you also should wash one anothers feet </s>
<s> i have set you an example that you should do as i have done for you </s>
<s> very truly i tell you  no servant is greater than his master  nor is a messenger greater than the one who sent him </s>
<s> now that you know these things  you will be blessed if you do them </s>
<s>  i am not referring to all of you  i know those i have chosen  but this is to fulfil this passage of scripture   he who shared my bread has turned against me  </s>
<s>  i am telling you now before it happens  so that when it does happen you will believe that i am who i am </s>
<s> very truly i tell you  whoever accepts anyone i send accepts me  and whoever accepts me accepts the one who sent me  </s>
<s> after he had said this  jesus was troubled in spirit and testified   very truly i tell you  one of you is going to betray me  </s>
<s> his disciples stared at one another  at a loss to know which of them he meant </s>
<s> one of them  the disciple whom jesus loved  was reclining next to him </s>
<s> simon peter motioned to this disciple and said   ask him which one he means  </s>
<s> leaning back against jesus  he asked him   lord  who is it  </s>
<s> jesus answered   it is the one to whom i will give this piece of bread when i have dipped it in the dish   then  dipping the piece of bread  he gave it to judas  the son of simon iscariot </s>
<s> as soon as judas took the bread  satan entered into him  so jesus told him   what you are about to do  do quickly  </s>
<s> but no one at the meal understood why jesus said this to him </s>
<s> since judas had charge of the money  some thought jesus was telling him to buy what was needed for the festival  or to give something to the poor </s>
<s> as soon as judas had taken the bread  he went out  and it was night </s>
<s> when he was gone  jesus said   now the son of man is glorified and god is glorified in him </s>
<s> if god is glorified in him  god will glorify the son in himself  and will glorify him at once </s>
<s>  my children  i will be with you only a little longer  you will look for me  and just as i told the jews  so i tell you now  where i am going  you cannot come </s>
<s>  a new command i give you  love one another  as i have loved you  so you must love one another </s>
<s> by this everyone will know that you are my disciples  if you love one another  </s>
<s> simon peter asked him   lord  where are you going   jesus replied   where i am going  you cannot follow now  but you will follow later  </s>
<s> peter asked   lord  why cant i follow you now  i will lay down my life for you  </s>
<s> then jesus answered   will you really lay down your life for me  very truly i tell you  before the cock crows  you will disown me three times </s>
<s>  do not let your hearts be troubled  you believe in god  believe also in me </s>
<s> my fathers house has many rooms  if that were not so  would i have told you that i am going there to prepare a place for you </s>
<s> and if i go and prepare a place for you  i will come back and take you to be with me that you also may be where i am </s>
<s> you know the way to the place where i am going  </s>
<s> thomas said to him   lord  we dont know where you are going  so how can we know the way  </s>
<s> jesus answered   i am the way and the truth and the life  no one comes to the father except through me </s>
<s> if you really know me  you will know my father as well  from now on  you do know him and have seen him  </s>
<s> philip said   lord  show us the father and that will be enough for us  </s>
<s> jesus answered   dont you know me  philip  even after i have been among you such a long time  anyone who has seen me has seen the father  how can you say   show us the father  </s>
<s> dont you believe that i am in the father  and that the father is in me  the words i say to you i do not speak on my own authority  rather  it is the father  living in me  who is doing his work </s>
<s> believe me when i say that i am in the father and the father is in me  or at least believe on the evidence of the works themselves </s>
<s> very truly i tell you  whoever believes in me will do the works i have been doing  and they will do even greater things than these  because i am going to the father </s>
<s> and i will do whatever you ask in my name  so that the father may be glorified in the son </s>
<s> you may ask me for anything in my name  and i will do it </s>
<s>  if you love me  keep my commands </s>
<s> and i will ask the father  and he will give you another advocate to help you and be with you for ever </s>
<s> the spirit of truth  the world cannot accept him  because it neither sees him nor knows him  but you know him  for he lives with you and will be in you </s>
<s> i will not leave you as orphans  i will come to you </s>
<s> before long  the world will not see me any more  but you will see me  because i live  you also will live </s>
<s> on that day you will realise that i am in my father  and you are in me  and i am in you </s>
<s> whoever has my commands and keeps them is the one who loves me  the one who loves me will be loved by my father  and i too will love them and show myself to them  </s>
<s> then judas  not judas iscariot  said   but  lord  why do you intend to show yourself to us and not to the world  </s>
<s> jesus replied   anyone who loves me will obey my teaching  my father will love them  and we will come to them and make our home with them </s>
<s> anyone who does not love me will not obey my teaching  these words you hear are not my own  they belong to the father who sent me </s>

<s> but the advocate  the holy spirit  whom the father will send in my name  will teach you all things and will remind you of everything i have said to you </s>
<s> peace i leave with you  my peace i give you  i do not give to you as the world gives  do not let your hearts be troubled and do not be afraid </s>
<s>  you heard me say   i am going away and i am coming back to you   if you loved me  you would be glad that i am going to the father  for the father is greater than i </s>
<s> i have told you now before it happens  so that when it does happen you will believe </s>
<s> i will not say much more to you  for the prince of this world is coming  he has no hold over me </s>
<s> but he comes so that the world may learn that i love the father and do exactly what my father has commanded me   come now  let us leave </s>
<s>  i am the true vine  and my father is the gardener </s>
<s> he cuts off every branch in me that bears no fruit  while every branch that does bear fruit he prunes so that it will be even more fruitful </s>
<s> you are already clean because of the word i have spoken to you </s>
<s> remain in me  as i also remain in you  no branch can bear fruit by itself  it must remain in the vine  neither can you bear fruit unless you remain in me </s>
<s>  i am the vine  you are the branches  if you remain in me and i in you  you will bear much fruit  apart from me you can do nothing </s>
<s> if you do not remain in me  you are like a branch that is thrown away and withers  such branches are picked up  thrown into the fire and burned </s>
<s> if you remain in me and my words remain in you  ask whatever you wish  and it will be done for you </s>
<s> this is to my fathers glory  that you bear much fruit  showing yourselves to be my disciples </s>
<s>  as the father has loved me  so have i loved you  now remain in my love </s>
<s> if you keep my commands  you will remain in my love  just as i have kept my fathers commands and remain in his love </s>
<s> i have told you this so that my joy may be in you and that your joy may be complete </s>
<s> my command is this  love each other as i have loved you </s>
<s> greater love has no one than this  to lay down ones life for ones friends </s>
<s> you are my friends if you do what i command </s>
<s> i no longer call you servants  because a servant does not know his masters business  instead  i have called you friends  for everything that i learned from my father i have made known to you </s>
<s> you did not choose me  but i chose you and appointed you so that you might go and bear fruit  fruit that will last  and so that whatever you ask in my name the father will give you </s>
<s> this is my command  love each other </s>
<s>  if the world hates you  keep in mind that it hated me first </s>
<s> if you belonged to the world  it would love you as its own  as it is  you do not belong to the world  but i have chosen you out of the world  that is why the world hates you </s>
<s> remember what i told you   a servant is not greater than his master   if they persecuted me  they will persecute you also  if they obeyed my teaching  they will obey yours also </s>
<s> they will treat you this way because of my name  for they do not know the one who sent me </s>
<s> if i had not come and spoken to them  they would not be guilty of sin  but now they have no excuse for their sin </s>
<s> whoever hates me hates my father as well </s>
<s> if i had not done among them the works no one else did  they would not be guilty of sin  as it is  they have seen  and yet they have hated both me and my father </s>
<s> but this is to fulfil what is written in their law   they hated me without reason  </s>
<s>  when the advocate comes  whom i will send to you from the father  the spirit of truth who goes out from the father  he will testify about me </s>
<s> and you also must testify  for you have been with me from the beginning </s>
<s>  all this i have told you so that you will not fall away </s>
<s> they will put you out of the synagogue  in fact  the time is coming when anyone who kills you will think they are offering a service to god </s>
<s> they will do such things because they have not known the father or me </s>
<s> i have told you this  so that when their time comes you will remember that i warned you about them  i did not tell you this from the beginning because i was with you </s>
<s> but now i am going to him who sent me  none of you asks me   where are you going  </s>
<s> rather  you are filled with grief because i have said these things </s>
<s> but very truly i tell you  it is for your good that i am going away  unless i go away  the advocate will not come to you  but if i go  i will send him to you </s>
<s> when he comes  he will prove the world to be in the wrong about sin and righteousness and judgment </s>
<s> about sin  because people do not believe in me </s>
<s> about righteousness  because i am going to the father  where you can see me no longer </s>
<s> and about judgment  because the prince of this world now stands condemned </s>
<s>  i have much more to say to you  more than you can now bear </s>
<s> but when he  the spirit of truth  comes  he will guide you into all the truth  he will not speak on his own  he will speak only what he hears  and he will tell you what is yet to come </s>
<s> he will glorify me because it is from me that he will receive what he will make known to you </s>
<s> all that belongs to the father is mine  that is why i said the spirit will receive from me what he will make known to you  </s>
<s> jesus went on to say   in a little while you will see me no more  and then after a little while you will see me  </s>
<s> at this  some of his disciples said to one another   what does he mean by saying   in a little while you will see me no more  and then after a little while you will see me   and  because i am going to the father   </s>
<s> they kept asking   what does he mean by  a little while   we dont understand what he is saying  </s>
<s> jesus saw that they wanted to ask him about this  so he said to them   are you asking one another what i meant when i said   in a little while you will see me no more  and then after a little while you will see me  </s>
<s> very truly i tell you  you will weep and mourn while the world rejoices  you will grieve  but your grief will turn to joy </s>
<s> a woman giving birth to a child has pain because her time has come  but when her baby is born she forgets the anguish because of her joy that a child is born into the world </s>
<s> so with you  now is your time of grief  but i will see you again and you will rejoice  and no one will take away your joy </s>
<s> in that day you will no longer ask me anything  very truly i tell you  my father will give you whatever you ask in my name </s>
<s> until now you have not asked for anything in my name  ask and you will receive  and your joy will be complete </s>
<s>  though i have been speaking figuratively  a time is coming when i will no longer use this kind of language but will tell you plainly about my father </s>
<s> in that day you will ask in my name  i am not saying that i will ask the father on your behalf </s>
<s> no  the father himself loves you because you have loved me and have believed that i came from god </s>
<s> i came from the father and entered the world  now i am leaving the world and going back to the father  </s>
<s> then jesus disciples said   now you are speaking clearly and without figures of speech </s>
<s> now we can see that you know all things and that you do not even need to have anyone ask you questions  this makes us believe that you came from god  </s>
<s>  do you now believe   jesus replied </s>
<s>  a time is coming and in fact has come when you will be scattered  each to your own home  you will leave me all alone  yet i am not alone  for my father is with me </s>
<s>  i have told you these things  so that in me you may have peace  in this world you will have trouble  but take heart  i have overcome the world  </s>
<s> after jesus said this  he looked towards heaven and prayed   father  the hour has come  glorify your son  that your son may glorify you </s>
<s> for you granted him authority over all people that he might give eternal life to all those you have given him </s>
<s> now this is eternal life  that they know you  the only true god  and jesus christ  whom you have sent </s>
<s> i have brought you glory on earth by finishing the work you gave me to do </s>
<s> and now  father  glorify me in your presence with the glory i had with you before the world began </s>
<s>  i have revealed you to those whom you gave me out of the world  they were yours  you gave them to me and they have obeyed your word </s>
<s> now they know that everything you have given me comes from you </s>
<s> for i gave them the words you gave me and they accepted them  they knew with certainty that i came from you  and they believed that you sent me </s>
<s> i pray for them  i am not praying for the world  but for those you have given me  for they are yours </s>
<s> all i have is yours  and all you have is mine  and glory has come to me through them </s>
<s> i will remain in the world no longer  but they are still in the world  and i am coming to you  holy father  protect them by the power of your name  the name you gave me  so that they may be one as we are one </s>
<s> while i was with them  i protected them and kept them safe by that name you gave me  none has been lost except the one doomed to destruction so that scripture would be fulfilled </s>
<s>  i am coming to you now  but i say these things while i am still in the world  so that they may have the full measure of my joy within them </s>
<s> i have given them your word and the world has hated them  for they are not of the world any more than i am of the world </s>
<s> my prayer is not that you take them out of the world but that you protect them from the evil one </s>
<s> they are not of the world  even as i am not of it </s>
<s> sanctify them by the truth  your word is truth </s>
<s> as you sent me into the world  i have sent them into the world </s>
<s> for them i sanctify myself  that they too may be truly sanctified </s>
<s>  my prayer is not for them alone  i pray also for those who will believe in me through their message </s>
<s> that all of them may be one  father  just as you are in me and i am in you  may they also be in us so that the world may believe that you have sent me </s>
<s> i have given them the glory that you gave me  that they may be one as we are one </s>
<s> i in them and you in me  so that they may be brought to complete unity  then the world will know that you sent me and have loved them even as you have loved me </s>
<s>  father  i want those you have given me to be with me where i am  and to see my glory  the glory you have given me because you loved me before the creation of the world </s>
<s>  righteous father  though the world does not know you  i know you  and they know that you have sent me </s>
<s> i have made you known to them  and will continue to make you known in order that the love you have for me may be in them and that i myself may be in them  </s>

<s> jesus answered   i told you that i am he  if you are looking for me  then let these men go  </s>
<s> this happened so that the words he had spoken would be fulfilled   i have not lost one of those you gave me  </s>
<s> then simon peter  who had a sword  drew it and struck the high priests servant  cutting off his right ear   the servants name was malchus  </s>
<s> jesus commanded peter   put your sword away  shall i not drink the cup the father has given me  </s>
<s> then the detachment of soldiers with its commander and the jewish officials arrested jesus  they bound him</s>
<s> and brought him first to annas  who was the fatherinlaw of caiaphas  the high priest that year </s>
<s> caiaphas was the one who had advised the jewish leaders that it would be good if one man died for the people </s>
<s> simon peter and another disciple were following jesus  because this disciple was known to the high priest  he went with jesus into the high priests courtyard </s>
<s> but peter had to wait outside at the door  the other disciple  who was known to the high priest  came back  spoke to the servantgirl on duty there and brought peter in </s>
<s>  you arent one of this mans disciples too  are you   she asked peter  he replied   i am not  </s>
<s> it was cold  and the servants and officials stood round a fire they had made to keep warm  peter also was standing with them  warming himself </s>
<s> meanwhile  the high priest questioned jesus about his disciples and his teaching </s>
<s>  i have spoken openly to the world   jesus replied   i always taught in synagogues or at the temple  where all the jews come together  i said nothing in secret </s>
<s> why question me  ask those who heard me  surely they know what i said  </s>
<s> when jesus said this  one of the officials near by slapped him in the face   is this the way you answer the high priest   he demanded </s>
<s>  if i said something wrong   jesus replied   testify as to what is wrong  but if i spoke the truth  why did you strike me  </s>
<s> then annas sent him bound to caiaphas the high priest </s>
<s> meanwhile  simon peter was still standing there warming himself  so they asked him   you arent one of his disciples too  are you   he denied it  saying   i am not  </s>
<s> one of the high priests servants  a relative of the man whose ear peter had cut off  challenged him   didnt i see you with him in the garden  </s>
<s> again peter denied it  and at that moment a cock began to crow </s>
<s> then the jewish leaders took jesus from caiaphas to the palace of the roman governor  by now it was early morning  and to avoid ceremonial uncleanness they did not enter the palace  because they wanted to be able to eat the passover </s>
<s> so pilate came out to them and asked   what charges are you bringing against this man  </s>
<s>  if he were not a criminal   they replied   we would not have handed him over to you  </s>
<s> pilate said   take him yourselves and judge him by your own law    but we have no right to execute anyone   they objected </s>
<s> this took place to fulfil what jesus had said about the kind of death he was going to die </s>
<s> pilate then went back inside the palace  summoned jesus and asked him   are you the king of the jews  </s>
<s>  is that your own idea   jesus asked   or did others talk to you about me  </s>
<s>  am i a jew   pilate replied   your own people and chief priests handed you over to me  what is it you have done  </s>
<s> jesus said   my kingdom is not of this world  if it were  my servants would fight to prevent my arrest by the jewish leaders  but now my kingdom is from another place  </s>
<s>  you are a king  then   said pilate  jesus answered   you say that i am a king  in fact  the reason i was born and came into the world is to testify to the truth  everyone on the side of truth listens to me  </s>
<s>  what is truth   retorted pilate  with this he went out again to the jews gathered there and said   i find no basis for a charge against him </s>
<s> but it is your custom for me to release to you one prisoner at the time of the passover  do you want me to release  the king of the jews   </s>
<s> they shouted back   no  not him  give us barabbas   now barabbas had taken part in an uprising </s>
<s> then pilate took jesus and had him flogged </s>
<s> the soldiers twisted together a crown of thorns and put it on his head  they clothed him in a purple robe</s>
<s> and went up to him again and again  saying   hail  king of the jews   and they slapped him in the face </s>
<s> once more pilate came out and said to the jews gathered there   look  i am bringing him out to you to let you know that i find no basis for a charge against him  </s>
<s> when jesus came out wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe  pilate said to them   here is the man  </s>
<s> as soon as the chief priests and their officials saw him  they shouted   crucify  crucify   but pilate answered   you take him and crucify him  as for me  i find no basis for a charge against him  </s>
<s> the jewish leaders insisted   we have a law  and according to that law he must die  because he claimed to be the son of god  </s>
<s> when pilate heard this  he was even more afraid </s>
<s> and he went back inside the palace   where do you come from   he asked jesus  but jesus gave him no answer </s>
<s>  do you refuse to speak to me   pilate said   dont you realise i have power either to free you or to crucify you  </s>
<s> jesus answered   you would have no power over me if it were not given to you from above  therefore the one who handed me over to you is guilty of a greater sin  </s>
<s> from then on  pilate tried to set jesus free  but the jewish leaders kept shouting   if you let this man go  you are no friend of caesar  anyone who claims to be a king opposes caesar  </s>
<s> when pilate heard this  he brought jesus out and sat down on the judges seat at a place known as the stone pavement  which in aramaic is gabbatha  </s>
<s> it was the day of preparation of the passover  it was about noon   here is your king   pilate said to the jews </s>
<s> but they shouted   take him away  take him away  crucify him    shall i crucify your king   pilate asked   we have no king but caesar   the chief priests answered </s>
<s> finally pilate handed him over to them to be crucified  so the soldiers took charge of jesus </s>
<s> carrying his own cross  he went out to the place of the skull  which in aramaic is called golgotha  </s>
<s> there they crucified him  and with him two others  one on each side and jesus in the middle </s>
<s> pilate had a notice prepared and fastened to the cross  it read  jesus of nazareth  the king of the jews </s>
<s> many of the jews read this sign  for the place where jesus was crucified was near the city  and the sign was written in aramaic  latin and greek </s>
<s> the chief priests of the jews protested to pilate   do not write  the king of the jews   but that this man claimed to be king of the jews  </s>
<s> pilate answered   what i have written  i have written  </s>
<s> when the soldiers crucified jesus  they took his clothes  dividing them into four shares  one for each of them  with the undergarment remaining  this garment was seamless  woven in one piece from top to bottom </s>
<s>  lets not tear it   they said to one another   lets decide by lot who will get it   this happened that the scripture might be fulfilled that said   they divided my clothes among them and cast lots for my garment  </s>
<s> near the cross of jesus stood his mother  his mothers sister  mary the wife of clopas  and mary magdalene </s>
<s> when jesus saw his mother there  and the disciple whom he loved standing near by  he said to her   woman  here is your son  </s>
<s> and to the disciple   here is your mother   from that time on  this disciple took her into his home </s>
<s> later  knowing that everything had now been finished  and so that scripture would be fulfilled  jesus said   i am thirsty  </s>
<s> a jar of wine vinegar was there  so they soaked a sponge in it  put the sponge on a stalk of the hyssop plant  and lifted it to jesus lips </s>
<s> when he had received the drink  jesus said   it is finished   with that  he bowed his head and gave up his spirit </s>
<s> now it was the day of preparation  and the next day was to be a special sabbath  because the jewish leaders did not want the bodies left on the crosses during the sabbath  they asked pilate to have the legs broken and the bodies taken down </s>
<s> the soldiers therefore came and broke the legs of the first man who had been crucified with jesus  and then those of the other </s>
<s> but when they came to jesus and found that he was already dead  they did not break his legs </s>
<s> instead  one of the soldiers pierced jesus side with a spear  bringing a sudden flow of blood and water </s>
<s> the man who saw it has given testimony  and his testimony is true  he knows that he tells the truth  and he testifies so that you also may believe </s>
<s> these things happened so that the scripture would be fulfilled   not one of his bones will be broken  </s>
<s> and  as another scripture says   they will look on the one they have pierced  </s>
<s> later  joseph of arimathea asked pilate for the body of jesus  now joseph was a disciple of jesus  but secretly because he feared the jewish leaders  with pilates permission  he came and took the body away </s>
<s> he was accompanied by nicodemus  the man who earlier had visited jesus at night  nicodemus brought a mixture of myrrh and aloes  about thirtyfive kilograms </s>
<s> taking jesus body  the two of them wrapped it  with the spices  in strips of linen  this was in accordance with jewish burial customs </s>
<s> at the place where jesus was crucified  there was a garden  and in the garden a new tomb  in which no one had ever been laid </s>
<s> because it was the jewish day of preparation and since the tomb was near by  they laid jesus there </s>
<s> early on the first day of the week  while it was still dark  mary magdalene went to the tomb and saw that the stone had been removed from the entrance </s>
<s> so she came running to simon peter and the other disciple  the one jesus loved  and said   they have taken the lord out of the tomb  and we dont know where they have put him  </s>
<s> so peter and the other disciple started for the tomb </s>
<s> both were running  but the other disciple outran peter and reached the tomb first </s>
<s> he bent over and looked in at the strips of linen lying there but did not go in </s>
<s> then simon peter came along behind him and went straight into the tomb  he saw the strips of linen lying there </s>
<s> as well as the cloth that had been wrapped round jesus head  the cloth was still lying in its place  separate from the linen </s>
<s> finally the other disciple  who had reached the tomb first  also went inside  he saw and believed </s>
<s>  they still did not understand from scripture that jesus had to rise from the dead  </s>
<s> then the disciples went back to where they were staying </s>
<s> now mary stood outside the tomb crying  as she wept  she bent over to look into the tomb</s>
<s> and saw two angels in white  seated where jesus body had been  one at the head and the other at the foot </s>
<s> they asked her   woman  why are you crying    they have taken my lord away   she said   and i dont know where they have put him  </s>
<s> at this  she turned round and saw jesus standing there  but she did not realise that it was jesus </s>
<s> he asked her   woman  why are you crying  who is it you are looking for   thinking he was the gardener  she said   sir  if you have carried him away  tell me where you have put him  and i will get him  </s>
<s> jesus said to her   mary   she turned towards him and cried out in aramaic   rabboni    which means  teacher  </s>
<s> jesus said   do not hold on to me  for i have not yet ascended to the father  go instead to my brothers and tell them   i am ascending to my father and your father  to my god and your god   </s>
<s> mary magdalene went to the disciples with the news   i have seen the lord   and she told them that he had said these things to her </s>
<s> on the evening of that first day of the week  when the disciples were together  with the doors locked for fear of the jewish leaders  jesus came and stood among them and said   peace be with you  </s>
<s> after he said this  he showed them his hands and side  the disciples were overjoyed when they saw the lord </s>
<s> again jesus said   peace be with you  as the father has sent me  i am sending you  </s>
<s> and with that he breathed on them and said   receive the holy spirit </s>
<s> if you forgive anyones sins  their sins are forgiven  if you do not forgive them  they are not forgiven  </s>
<s> now thomas  also known as didymus   one of the twelve  was not with the disciples when jesus came </s>
<s> so the other disciples told him   we have seen the lord   but he said to them   unless i see the nail marks in his hands and put my finger where the nails were  and put my hand into his side  i will not believe  </s>
<s> a week later his disciples were in the house again  and thomas was with them  though the doors were locked  jesus came and stood among them and said   peace be with you  </s>
<s> then he said to thomas   put your finger here  see my hands  reach out your hand and put it into my side  stop doubting and believe  </s>
<s> thomas said to him   my lord and my god  </s>
<s> then jesus told him   because you have seen me  you have believed  blessed are those who have not seen and yet have believed  </s>
<s> jesus performed many other signs in the presence of his disciples  which are not recorded in this book </s>
<s> but these are written that you may believe that jesus is the messiah  the son of god  and that by believing you may have life in his name </s>
<s> afterwards jesus appeared again to his disciples  by the sea of galilee  it happened this way </s>
<s> simon peter  thomas  also known as didymus   nathanael from cana in galilee  the sons of zebedee  and two other disciples were together </s>
<s>  im going out to fish   simon peter told them  and they said   well go with you   so they went out and got into the boat  but that night they caught nothing </s>
<s> early in the morning  jesus stood on the shore  but the disciples did not realise that it was jesus </s>
<s> he called out to them   friends  havent you any fish    no   they answered </s>
<s> he said   throw your net on the right side of the boat and you will find some   when they did  they were unable to haul the net in because of the large number of fish </s>
<s> then the disciple whom jesus loved said to peter   it is the lord   as soon as simon peter heard him say   it is the lord   he wrapped his outer garment round him  for he had taken it off  and jumped into the water </s>
<s> the other disciples followed in the boat  towing the net full of fish  for they were not far from shore  about a hundred metres </s>
<s> when they landed  they saw a fire of burning coals there with fish on it  and some bread </s>
<s> jesus said to them   bring some of the fish you have just caught  </s>
<s> so simon peter climbed back into the boat and dragged the net ashore  it was full of large fish  153  but even with so many the net was not torn </s>
<s> jesus said to them   come and have breakfast   none of the disciples dared ask him   who are you   they knew it was the lord </s>
<s> jesus came  took the bread and gave it to them  and did the same with the fish </s>
<s> this was now the third time jesus appeared to his disciples after he was raised from the dead </s>
<s> when they had finished eating  jesus said to simon peter   simon son of john  do you love me more than these    yes  lord   he said   you know that i love you   jesus said   feed my lambs  </s>
<s> again jesus said   simon son of john  do you love me   he answered   yes  lord  you know that i love you   jesus said   take care of my sheep  </s>
<s> the third time he said to him   simon son of john  do you love me   peter was hurt because jesus asked him the third time   do you love me   he said   lord  you know all things  you know that i love you   jesus said   feed my sheep </s>
<s> very truly i tell you  when you were younger you dressed yourself and went where you wanted  but when you are old you will stretch out your hands  and someone else will dress you and lead you where you do not want to go  </s>
<s> jesus said this to indicate the kind of death by which peter would glorify god  then he said to him   follow me  </s>
<s> peter turned and saw that the disciple whom jesus loved was following them   this was the one who had leaned back against jesus at the supper and had said   lord  who is going to betray you   </s>
<s> when peter saw him  he asked   lord  what about him  </s>
<s> jesus answered   if i want him to remain alive until i return  what is that to you  you must follow me  </s>
<s> because of this  the rumour spread among the believers that this disciple would not die  but jesus did not say that he would not die  he only said   if i want him to remain alive until i return  what is that to you  </s>
<s> this is the disciple who testifies to these things and who wrote them down  we know that his testimony is true </s>
<s> jesus did many other things as well  if every one of them were written down  i suppose that even the whole world would not have room for the books that would be written </s>
<s> in my former book  theophilus  i wrote about all that jesus began to do and to teach</s>
<s> until the day he was taken up to heaven  after giving instructions through the holy spirit to the apostles he had chosen </s>
<s> after his suffering  he presented himself to them and gave many convincing proofs that he was alive  he appeared to them over a period of forty days and spoke about the kingdom of god </s>
<s> on one occasion  while he was eating with them  he gave them this command   do not leave jerusalem  but wait for the gift my father promised  which you have heard me speak about </s>
<s> for john baptised with water  but in a few days you will be baptised with the holy spirit  </s>
<s> then they gathered round him and asked him   lord  are you at this time going to restore the kingdom to israel  </s>
<s> he said to them   it is not for you to know the times or dates the father has set by his own authority </s>
<s> but you will receive power when the holy spirit comes on you  and you will be my witnesses in jerusalem  and in all judea and samaria  and to the ends of the earth  </s>
<s> after he said this  he was taken up before their very eyes  and a cloud hid him from their sight </s>
<s> they were looking intently up into the sky as he was going  when suddenly two men dressed in white stood beside them </s>
<s>  men of galilee   they said   why do you stand here looking into the sky  this same jesus  who has been taken from you into heaven  will come back in the same way you have seen him go into heaven  </s>
<s> then the apostles returned to jerusalem from the hill called the mount of olives  a sabbath days walk from the city </s>
<s> when they arrived  they went upstairs to the room where they were staying  those present were peter  john  james and andrew  philip and thomas  bartholomew and matthew  james son of alphaeus and simon the zealot  and judas son of james </s>
<s> they all joined together constantly in prayer  along with the women and mary the mother of jesus  and with his brothers </s>
<s> in those days peter stood up among the believers  a group numbering about a hundred and twenty </s>
<s> and said   brothers and sisters  the scripture had to be fulfilled in which the holy spirit spoke long ago through david concerning judas  who served as guide for those who arrested jesus </s>
<s> he was one of our number and shared in our ministry  </s>
<s>  with the payment he received for his wickedness  judas bought a field  there he fell headlong  his body burst open and all his intestines spilled out </s>
<s> everyone in jerusalem heard about this  so they called that field in their language akeldama  that is  field of blood  </s>
<s>  for   said peter   it is written in the book of psalms    may his place be deserted  let there be no one to dwell in it     may another take his place of leadership  </s>
<s> so they nominated two men  joseph called barsabbas  also known as justus  and matthias </s>
<s> then they prayed   lord  you know everyones heart  show us which of these two you have chosen</s>
<s> to take over this apostolic ministry  which judas left to go where he belongs  </s>
<s> then they cast lots  and the lot fell to matthias  so he was added to the eleven apostles </s>
<s> when the day of pentecost came  they were all together in one place </s>
<s> suddenly a sound like the blowing of a violent wind came from heaven and filled the whole house where they were sitting </s>
<s> they saw what seemed to be tongues of fire that separated and came to rest on each of them </s>
<s> all of them were filled with the holy spirit and began to speak in other tongues as the spirit enabled them </s>
<s> now there were staying in jerusalem godfearing jews from every nation under heaven </s>
<s> when they heard this sound  a crowd came together in bewilderment  because each one heard their own language being spoken </s>
<s> utterly amazed  they asked   arent all these who are speaking galileans </s>
<s> then how is it that each of us hears them in our native language </s>
<s> parthians  medes and elamites  residents of mesopotamia  judea and cappadocia  pontus and asia </s>
<s> phrygia and pamphylia  egypt and the parts of libya near cyrene  visitors from rome</s>
<s>  both jews and converts to judaism   cretans and arabs  we hear them declaring the wonders of god in our own tongues  </s>
<s> amazed and perplexed  they asked one another   what does this mean  </s>
<s> some  however  made fun of them and said   they have had too much wine  </s>
<s> then peter stood up with the eleven  raised his voice and addressed the crowd   fellow jews and all of you who live in jerusalem  let me explain this to you  listen carefully to what i say </s>
<s> these people are not drunk  as you suppose  its only nine in the morning </s>
<s> no  this is what was spoken by the prophet joel </s>
<s>   in the last days  god says  i will pour out my spirit on all people  your sons and daughters will prophesy  your young men will see visions  your old men will dream dreams </s>
<s> even on my servants  both men and women  i will pour out my spirit in those days  and they will prophesy </s>
<s> i will show wonders in the heavens above and signs on the earth below  blood and fire and billows of smoke </s>
<s> the sun will be turned to darkness and the moon to blood before the coming of the great and glorious day of the lord </s>
<s> and everyone who calls on the name of the lord will be saved  </s>
<s>  fellow israelites  listen to this  jesus of nazareth was a man accredited by god to you by miracles  wonders and signs  which god did among you through him  as you yourselves know </s>
<s> this man was handed over to you by gods deliberate plan and foreknowledge  and you  with the help of wicked men  put him to death by nailing him to the cross </s>
<s> but god raised him from the dead  freeing him from the agony of death  because it was impossible for death to keep its hold on him </s>
<s> david said about him    i saw the lord always before me  because he is at my right hand  i will not be shaken </s>
<s> therefore my heart is glad and my tongue rejoices  my body also will rest in hope </s>
<s> because you will not abandon me to the realm of the dead  you will not let your holy one see decay </s>
<s> you have made known to me the paths of life  you will fill me with joy in your presence  </s>
<s>  fellow israelites  i can tell you confidently that the patriarch david died and was buried  and his tomb is here to this day </s>
<s> but he was a prophet and knew that god had promised him on oath that he would place one of his descendants on his throne </s>
<s> seeing what was to come  he spoke of the resurrection of the messiah  that he was not abandoned to the realm of the dead  nor did his body see decay </s>
<s> god has raised this jesus to life  and we are all witnesses of it </s>
<s> exalted to the right hand of god  he has received from the father the promised holy spirit and has poured out what you now see and hear </s>
<s> for david did not ascend to heaven  and yet he said    the lord said to my lord   sit at my right hand</s>
<s> until i make your enemies a footstool for your feet   </s>
<s>  therefore let all israel be assured of this  god has made this jesus  whom you crucified  both lord and messiah  </s>
<s> when the people heard this  they were cut to the heart and said to peter and the other apostles   brothers  what shall we do  </s>
<s> peter replied   repent and be baptised  every one of you  in the name of jesus christ for the forgiveness of your sins  and you will receive the gift of the holy spirit </s>
<s> the promise is for you and your children and for all who are far off  for all whom the lord our god will call  </s>
<s> with many other words he warned them  and he pleaded with them   save yourselves from this corrupt generation  </s>
<s> those who accepted his message were baptised  and about three thousand were added to their number that day </s>
<s> they devoted themselves to the apostles teaching and to fellowship  to the breaking of bread and to prayer </s>
<s> everyone was filled with awe at the many wonders and signs performed by the apostles </s>
<s> all the believers were together and had everything in common </s>
<s> they sold property and possessions to give to anyone who had need </s>
<s> every day they continued to meet together in the temple courts  they broke bread in their homes and ate together with glad and sincere hearts </s>
<s> praising god and enjoying the favour of all the people  and the lord added to their number daily those who were being saved </s>
<s> one day peter and john were going up to the temple at the time of prayer  at three in the afternoon </s>
<s> now a man who was lame from birth was being carried to the temple gate called beautiful  where he was put every day to beg from those going into the temple courts </s>
<s> when he saw peter and john about to enter  he asked them for money </s>
<s> peter looked straight at him  as did john  then peter said   look at us  </s>
<s> so the man gave them his attention  expecting to get something from them </s>
<s> then peter said   silver or gold i do not have  but what i do have i give you  in the name of jesus christ of nazareth  walk  </s>
<s> taking him by the right hand  he helped him up  and instantly the mans feet and ankles became strong </s>
<s> he jumped to his feet and began to walk  then he went with them into the temple courts  walking and jumping  and praising god </s>
<s> when all the people saw him walking and praising god </s>
<s> they recognised him as the same man who used to sit begging at the temple gate called beautiful  and they were filled with wonder and amazement at what had happened to him </s>
<s> while the man held on to peter and john  all the people were astonished and came running to them in the place called solomons colonnade </s>
<s> when peter saw this  he said to them   fellow israelites  why does this surprise you  why do you stare at us as if by our own power or godliness we had made this man walk </s>
<s> the god of abraham  isaac and jacob  the god of our fathers  has glorified his servant jesus  you handed him over to be killed  and you disowned him before pilate  though he had decided to let him go </s>
<s> you disowned the holy and righteous one and asked that a murderer be released to you </s>
<s> you killed the author of life  but god raised him from the dead  we are witnesses of this </s>
<s> by faith in the name of jesus  this man whom you see and know was made strong  it is jesus name and the faith that comes through him that has completely healed him  as you can all see </s>
<s>  now  fellow israelites  i know that you acted in ignorance  as did your leaders </s>
<s> but this is how god fulfilled what he had foretold through all the prophets  saying that his messiah would suffer </s>
<s> repent  then  and turn to god  so that your sins may be wiped out  that times of refreshing may come from the lord </s>
<s> and that he may send the messiah  who has been appointed for you  even jesus </s>
<s> heaven must receive him until the time comes for god to restore everything  as he promised long ago through his holy prophets </s>
<s> for moses said   the lord your god will raise up for you a prophet like me from among your own people  you must listen to everything he tells you </s>
<s> anyone who does not listen to him will be completely cut off from their people  </s>
<s>  indeed  beginning with samuel  all the prophets who have spoken have foretold these days </s>
<s> and you are heirs of the prophets and of the covenant god made with your fathers  he said to abraham   through your offspring all peoples on earth will be blessed  </s>
<s> when god raised up his servant  he sent him first to you to bless you by turning each of you from your wicked ways  </s>
<s> the priests and the captain of the temple guard and the sadducees came up to peter and john while they were speaking to the people </s>
<s> they were greatly disturbed because the apostles were teaching the people  proclaiming in jesus the resurrection of the dead </s>
<s> they seized peter and john and  because it was evening  they put them in jail until the next day </s>
<s> but many who heard the message believed  so the number of men who believed grew to about five thousand </s>
<s> the next day the rulers  the elders and the teachers of the law met in jerusalem </s>
<s> annas the high priest was there  and so were caiaphas  john  alexander and others of the high priests family </s>
<s> they had peter and john brought before them and began to question them   by what power or what name did you do this  </s>
<s> then peter  filled with the holy spirit  said to them   rulers and elders of the people </s>
<s> if we are being called to account today for an act of kindness shown to a man who was lame and are being asked how he was healed </s>
<s> then know this  you and all the people of israel  it is by the name of jesus christ of nazareth  whom you crucified but whom god raised from the dead  that this man stands before you healed </s>
<s> jesus is   the stone you builders rejected  which has become the cornerstone  </s>
<s> when they saw the courage of peter and john and realised that they were unschooled  ordinary men  they were astonished and they took note that these men had been with jesus </s>
<s> but since they could see the man who had been healed standing there with them  there was nothing they could say </s>
<s> so they ordered them to withdraw from the sanhedrin and then conferred together </s>
<s>  what are we going to do with these men   they asked   everyone living in jerusalem knows they have performed a notable sign  and we cannot deny it </s>
<s> but to stop this thing from spreading any further among the people  we must warn them to speak no longer to anyone in this name  </s>
<s> then they called them in again and commanded them not to speak or teach at all in the name of jesus </s>
<s> but peter and john replied   which is right in gods eyes  to listen to you  or to him  you be the judges </s>
<s> as for us  we cannot help speaking about what we have seen and heard  </s>
<s> after further threats they let them go  they could not decide how to punish them  because all the people were praising god for what had happened </s>
<s> for the man who was miraculously healed was over forty years old </s>
<s> on their release  peter and john went back to their own people and reported all that the chief priests and the elders had said to them </s>
<s> when they heard this  they raised their voices together in prayer to god   sovereign lord   they said   you made the heavens and the earth and the sea  and everything in them </s>
<s> you spoke by the holy spirit through the mouth of your servant  our father david    why do the nations rage and the peoples plot in vain </s>
<s> the kings of the earth rise up and the rulers band together against the lord and against his anointed one  </s>
<s> after they prayed  the place where they were meeting was shaken  and they were all filled with the holy spirit and spoke the word of god boldly </s>
<s> all the believers were one in heart and mind  no one claimed that any of their possessions was their own  but they shared everything they had </s>
<s> with great power the apostles continued to testify to the resurrection of the lord jesus  and gods grace was so powerfully at work in them all</s>
<s> that there was no needy person among them  for from time to time those who owned land or houses sold them  brought the money from the sales</s>
<s> and put it at the apostles feet  and it was distributed to anyone who had need </s>
<s> joseph  a levite from cyprus  whom the apostles called barnabas  which means  son of encouragement  </s>
<s> sold a field he owned and brought the money and put it at the apostles feet </s>
<s> now a man named ananias  together with his wife sapphira  also sold a piece of property </s>
<s> with his wifes full knowledge he kept back part of the money for himself  but brought the rest and put it at the apostles feet </s>
<s> then peter said   ananias  how is it that satan has so filled your heart that you have lied to the holy spirit and have kept for yourself some of the money you received for the land </s>
<s> didnt it belong to you before it was sold  and after it was sold  wasnt the money at your disposal  what made you think of doing such a thing  you have not lied just to human beings but to god  </s>
<s> when ananias heard this  he fell down and died  and great fear seized all who heard what had happened </s>
<s> then some young men came forward  wrapped up his body  and carried him out and buried him </s>
<s> about three hours later his wife came in  not knowing what had happened </s>
<s> peter asked her   tell me  is this the price you and ananias got for the land    yes   she said   that is the price  </s>
<s> peter said to her   how could you conspire to test the spirit of the lord  listen  the feet of the men who buried your husband are at the door  and they will carry you out also  </s>
<s> at that moment she fell down at his feet and died  then the young men came in and  finding her dead  carried her out and buried her beside her husband </s>
<s> great fear seized the whole church and all who heard about these events </s>
<s> the apostles performed many signs and wonders among the people  and all the believers used to meet together in solomons colonnade </s>
<s> no one else dared join them  even though they were highly regarded by the people </s>
<s> nevertheless  more and more men and women believed in the lord and were added to their number </s>
<s> as a result  people brought those who were ill into the streets and laid them on beds and mats so that at least peters shadow might fall on some of them as he passed by </s>
<s> crowds gathered also from the towns around jerusalem  bringing those who were ill and those tormented by impure spirits  and all of them were healed </s>
<s> then the high priest and all his associates  who were members of the party of the sadducees  were filled with jealousy </s>
<s> they arrested the apostles and put them in the public jail </s>
<s> but during the night an angel of the lord opened the doors of the jail and brought them out </s>
<s>  go  stand in the temple courts   he said   and tell the people all about this new life  </s>
<s> at daybreak they entered the temple courts  as they had been told  and began to teach the people  when the high priest and his associates arrived  they called together the sanhedrin  the full assembly of the elders of israel  and sent to the jail for the apostles </s>
<s> but on arriving at the jail  the officers did not find them there  so they went back and reported </s>
<s>  we found the jail securely locked  with the guards standing at the doors  but when we opened them  we found no one inside  </s>
<s> on hearing this report  the captain of the temple guard and the chief priests were at a loss  wondering what this might lead to </s>
<s> then someone came and said   look  the men you put in jail are standing in the temple courts teaching the people  </s>
<s> at that  the captain went with his officers and brought the apostles  they did not use force  because they feared that the people would stone them </s>
<s> the apostles were brought in and made to appear before the sanhedrin to be questioned by the high priest </s>
<s>  we gave you strict orders not to teach in this name   he said   yet you have filled jerusalem with your teaching and are determined to make us guilty of this mans blood  </s>
<s> peter and the other apostles replied   we must obey god rather than human beings </s>
<s> the god of our ancestors raised jesus from the dead  whom you killed by hanging him on a cross </s>
<s> god exalted him to his own right hand as prince and saviour that he might bring israel to repentance and forgive their sins </s>
<s> we are witnesses of these things  and so is the holy spirit  whom god has given to those who obey him  </s>
<s> when they heard this  they were furious and wanted to put them to death </s>
<s> but a pharisee named gamaliel  a teacher of the law  who was honoured by all the people  stood up in the sanhedrin and ordered that the men be put outside for a little while </s>
<s> then he addressed the sanhedrin   men of israel  consider carefully what you intend to do to these men </s>
<s> some time ago theudas appeared  claiming to be somebody  and about four hundred men rallied to him  he was killed  all his followers were dispersed  and it all came to nothing </s>
<s> after him  judas the galilean appeared in the days of the census and led a band of people in revolt  he too was killed  and all his followers were scattered </s>
<s> therefore  in the present case i advise you  leave these men alone  let them go  for if their purpose or activity is of human origin  it will fail </s>
<s> but if it is from god  you will not be able to stop these men  you will only find yourselves fighting against god  </s>
<s> his speech persuaded them  they called the apostles in and had them flogged  then they ordered them not to speak in the name of jesus  and let them go </s>
<s> the apostles left the sanhedrin  rejoicing because they had been counted worthy of suffering disgrace for the name </s>
<s> day after day  in the temple courts and from house to house  they never stopped teaching and proclaiming the good news that jesus is the messiah </s>
<s> in those days when the number of disciples was increasing  the hellenistic jews among them complained against the hebraic jews because their widows were being overlooked in the daily distribution of food </s>
<s> so the twelve gathered all the disciples together and said   it would not be right for us to neglect the ministry of the word of god in order to wait on tables </s>
<s> brothers and sisters  choose seven men from among you who are known to be full of the spirit and wisdom  we will turn this responsibility over to them</s>
<s> and will give our attention to prayer and the ministry of the word  </s>
<s> this proposal pleased the whole group  they chose stephen  a man full of faith and of the holy spirit  also philip  procorus  nicanor  timon  parmenas  and nicolas from antioch  a convert to judaism </s>
<s> they presented these men to the apostles  who prayed and laid their hands on them </s>
<s> so the word of god spread  the number of disciples in jerusalem increased rapidly  and a large number of priests became obedient to the faith </s>
<s> now stephen  a man full of gods grace and power  performed great wonders and signs among the people </s>
<s> opposition arose  however  from members of the synagogue of the freedmen  as it was called   jews of cyrene and alexandria as well as the provinces of cilicia and asia  who began to argue with stephen </s>
<s> but they could not stand up against the wisdom the spirit gave him as he spoke </s>
<s> then they secretly persuaded some men to say   we have heard stephen speak blasphemous words against moses and against god  </s>
<s> so they stirred up the people and the elders and the teachers of the law  they seized stephen and brought him before the sanhedrin </s>
<s> they produced false witnesses  who testified   this fellow never stops speaking against this holy place and against the law </s>
<s> for we have heard him say that this jesus of nazareth will destroy this place and change the customs moses handed down to us  </s>
<s> all who were sitting in the sanhedrin looked intently at stephen  and they saw that his face was like the face of an angel </s>
<s> then the high priest asked stephen   are these charges true  </s>
<s> to this he replied   brothers and fathers  listen to me  the god of glory appeared to our father abraham while he was still in mesopotamia  before he lived in harran </s>
<s>  leave your country and your people   god said   and go to the land i will show you  </s>
<s>  so he left the land of the chaldeans and settled in harran  after the death of his father  god sent him to this land where you are now living </s>
<s> he gave him no inheritance here  not even enough ground to set his foot on  but god promised him that he and his descendants after him would possess the land  even though at that time abraham had no child </s>
<s> god spoke to him in this way   for four hundred years your descendants will be strangers in a country not their own  and they will be enslaved and illtreated </s>
<s> but i will punish the nation they serve as slaves   god said   and afterwards they will come out of that country and worship me in this place  </s>
<s> then he gave abraham the covenant of circumcision  and abraham became the father of isaac and circumcised him eight days after his birth  later isaac became the father of jacob  and jacob became the father of the twelve patriarchs </s>
<s>  because the patriarchs were jealous of joseph  they sold him as a slave into egypt  but god was with him</s>
<s> and rescued him from all his troubles  he gave joseph wisdom and enabled him to gain the goodwill of pharaoh king of egypt  so pharaoh made him ruler over egypt and all his palace </s>
<s>  then a famine struck all egypt and canaan  bringing great suffering  and our ancestors could not find food </s>
<s> when jacob heard that there was grain in egypt  he sent our forefathers on their first visit </s>
<s> on their second visit  joseph told his brothers who he was  and pharaoh learned about josephs family </s>
<s> after this  joseph sent for his father jacob and his whole family  seventyfive in all </s>
<s> then jacob went down to egypt  where he and our ancestors died </s>
<s> their bodies were brought back to shechem and placed in the tomb that abraham had bought from the sons of hamor at shechem for a certain sum of money </s>
<s>  as the time drew near for god to fulfil his promise to abraham  the number of our people in egypt had greatly increased </s>
<s> then  a new king  to whom joseph meant nothing  came to power in egypt  </s>
<s> he dealt treacherously with our people and oppressed our ancestors by forcing them to throw out their newborn babies so that they would die </s>
<s>  at that time moses was born  and he was no ordinary child  for three months he was cared for by his family </s>
<s> when he was placed outside  pharaohs daughter took him and brought him up as her own son </s>
<s> moses was educated in all the wisdom of the egyptians and was powerful in speech and action </s>
<s>  when moses was forty years old  he decided to visit his own people  the israelites </s>
<s> he saw one of them being illtreated by an egyptian  so he went to his defence and avenged him by killing the egyptian </s>
<s> moses thought that his own people would realise that god was using him to rescue them  but they did not </s>
<s> the next day moses came upon two israelites who were fighting  he tried to reconcile them by saying   men  you are brothers  why do you want to hurt each other  </s>
<s>  but the man who was illtreating the other pushed moses aside and said   who made you ruler and judge over us </s>
<s> are you thinking of killing me as you killed the egyptian yesterday  </s>
<s> when moses heard this  he fled to midian  where he settled as a foreigner and had two sons </s>
<s>  after forty years had passed  an angel appeared to moses in the flames of a burning bush in the desert near mount sinai </s>
<s> when he saw this  he was amazed at the sight  as he went over to get a closer look  he heard the lord say </s>
<s>  i am the god of your fathers  the god of abraham  isaac and jacob   moses trembled with fear and did not dare to look </s>
<s>  then the lord said to him   take off your sandals  for the place where you are standing is holy ground </s>
<s> i have indeed seen the oppression of my people in egypt  i have heard their groaning and have come down to set them free  now come  i will send you back to egypt  </s>
<s>  this is the same moses they had rejected with the words   who made you ruler and judge   he was sent to be their ruler and deliverer by god himself  through the angel who appeared to him in the bush </s>
<s> he led them out of egypt and performed wonders and signs in egypt  at the red sea and for forty years in the wilderness </s>
<s>  this is the moses who told the israelites   god will raise up for you a prophet like me from your own people  </s>
<s> he was in the assembly in the wilderness  with the angel who spoke to him on mount sinai  and with our ancestors  and he received living words to pass on to us </s>
<s>  but our ancestors refused to obey him  instead  they rejected him and in their hearts turned back to egypt </s>
<s> they told aaron   make us gods who will go before us  as for this fellow moses who led us out of egypt  we dont know what has happened to him  </s>
<s> that was the time they made an idol in the form of a calf  they brought sacrifices to it and revelled in what their own hands had made </s>
<s> but god turned away from them and gave them over to the worship of the sun  moon and stars  this agrees with what is written in the book of the prophets    did you bring me sacrifices and offerings for forty years in the wilderness  people of israel </s>
<s> you have taken up the tabernacle of molek and the star of your god rephan  the idols you made to worship  therefore i will send you into exile  beyond babylon </s>
<s>  our ancestors had the tabernacle of the covenant law with them in the wilderness  it had been made as god directed moses  according to the pattern he had seen </s>
<s> after receiving the tabernacle  our ancestors under joshua brought it with them when they took the land from the nations god drove out before them  it remained in the land until the time of david </s>
<s> who enjoyed gods favour and asked that he might provide a dwellingplace for the god of jacob </s>
<s> but it was solomon who built a house for him </s>
<s>  however  the most high does not live in houses made by human hands  as the prophet says </s>
<s>   heaven is my throne  and the earth is my footstool  what kind of house will you build for me  or where will my resting place be </s>
<s> has not my hand made all these things  </s>
<s>  you stiffnecked people  your hearts and ears are still uncircumcised  you are just like your ancestors  you always resist the holy spirit </s>
<s> was there ever a prophet your ancestors did not persecute  they even killed those who predicted the coming of the righteous one  and now you have betrayed and murdered him </s>
<s> you who have received the law that was given through angels but have not obeyed it  </s>
<s> when the members of the sanhedrin heard this  they were furious and gnashed their teeth at him </s>
<s> but stephen  full of the holy spirit  looked up to heaven and saw the glory of god  and jesus standing at the right hand of god </s>
<s>  look   he said   i see heaven open and the son of man standing at the right hand of god  </s>
<s> at this they covered their ears and  yelling at the top of their voices  they all rushed at him </s>
<s> dragged him out of the city and began to stone him  meanwhile  the witnesses laid their coats at the feet of a young man named saul </s>
<s> while they were stoning him  stephen prayed   lord jesus  receive my spirit  </s>
<s> then he fell on his knees and cried out   lord  do not hold this sin against them   when he had said this  he fell asleep </s>
<s> and saul approved of their killing him  on that day a great persecution broke out against the church in jerusalem  and all except the apostles were scattered throughout judea and samaria </s>
<s> godly men buried stephen and mourned deeply for him </s>
<s> but saul began to destroy the church  going from house to house  he dragged off both men and women and put them in prison </s>
<s> those who had been scattered preached the word wherever they went </s>
<s> philip went down to a city in samaria and proclaimed the messiah there </s>
<s> when the crowds heard philip and saw the signs he performed  they all paid close attention to what he said </s>
<s> for with shrieks  impure spirits came out of many  and many who were paralysed or lame were healed </s>
<s> so there was great joy in that city </s>
<s> now for some time a man named simon had practised sorcery in the city and amazed all the people of samaria  he boasted that he was someone great </s>
<s> and all the people  both high and low  gave him their attention and exclaimed   this man is rightly called the great power of god  </s>
<s> they followed him because he had amazed them for a long time with his sorcery </s>
<s> but when they believed philip as he proclaimed the good news of the kingdom of god and the name of jesus christ  they were baptised  both men and women </s>
<s> simon himself believed and was baptised  and he followed philip everywhere  astonished by the great signs and miracles he saw </s>
<s> when the apostles in jerusalem heard that samaria had accepted the word of god  they sent peter and john to samaria </s>
<s> when they arrived  they prayed for the new believers there that they might receive the holy spirit </s>
<s> because the holy spirit had not yet come on any of them  they had simply been baptised in the name of the lord jesus </s>
<s> then peter and john placed their hands on them  and they received the holy spirit </s>
<s> when simon saw that the spirit was given at the laying on of the apostles hands  he offered them money</s>
<s> and said   give me also this ability so that everyone on whom i lay my hands may receive the holy spirit  </s>
<s> peter answered   may your money perish with you  because you thought you could buy the gift of god with money </s>
<s> you have no part or share in this ministry  because your heart is not right before god </s>
<s> repent of this wickedness and pray to the lord in the hope that he may forgive you for having such a thought in your heart </s>
<s> for i see that you are full of bitterness and captive to sin  </s>
<s> then simon answered   pray to the lord for me so that nothing you have said may happen to me  </s>
<s> after they had further proclaimed the word of the lord and testified about jesus  peter and john returned to jerusalem  preaching the gospel in many samaritan villages </s>
<s> now an angel of the lord said to philip   go south to the road  the desert road  that goes down from jerusalem to gaza  </s>
<s> so he started out  and on his way he met an ethiopian eunuch  an important official in charge of all the treasury of the kandake  which means  queen of the ethiopians   this man had gone to jerusalem to worship </s>
<s> and on his way home was sitting in his chariot reading the book of isaiah the prophet </s>
<s> the spirit told philip   go to that chariot and stay near it  </s>
<s> then philip ran up to the chariot and heard the man reading isaiah the prophet   do you understand what you are reading   philip asked </s>
<s>  how can i   he said   unless someone explains it to me   so he invited philip to come up and sit with him </s>
<s> this is the passage of scripture the eunuch was reading   he was led like a sheep to the slaughter  and as a lamb before its shearer is silent  so he did not open his mouth </s>
<s> in his humiliation he was deprived of justice  who can speak of his descendants  for his life was taken from the earth  </s>
<s> the eunuch asked philip   tell me  please  who is the prophet talking about  himself or someone else  </s>
<s> then philip began with that very passage of scripture and told him the good news about jesus </s>
<s> as they travelled along the road  they came to some water and the eunuch said   look  here is water  what can stand in the way of my being baptised   </s>
<s> </s>
<s> and he gave orders to stop the chariot  then both philip and the eunuch went down into the water and philip baptised him </s>
<s> when they came up out of the water  the spirit of the lord suddenly took philip away  and the eunuch did not see him again  but went on his way rejoicing </s>
<s> philip  however  appeared at azotus and travelled about  preaching the gospel in all the towns until he reached caesarea </s>
<s> meanwhile  saul was still breathing out murderous threats against the lords disciples  he went to the high priest</s>
<s> and asked him for letters to the synagogues in damascus  so that if he found any there who belonged to the way  whether men or women  he might take them as prisoners to jerusalem </s>
<s> as he neared damascus on his journey  suddenly a light from heaven flashed around him </s>
<s> he fell to the ground and heard a voice say to him   saul  saul  why do you persecute me  </s>
<s>  who are you  lord   saul asked   i am jesus  whom you are persecuting   he replied </s>
<s>  now get up and go into the city  and you will be told what you must do  </s>
<s> the men travelling with saul stood there speechless  they heard the sound but did not see anyone </s>
<s> saul got up from the ground  but when he opened his eyes he could see nothing  so they led him by the hand into damascus </s>
<s> for three days he was blind  and did not eat or drink anything </s>
<s> in damascus there was a disciple named ananias  the lord called to him in a vision   ananias    yes  lord   he answered </s>
<s> the lord told him   go to the house of judas on straight street and ask for a man from tarsus named saul  for he is praying </s>
<s> in a vision he has seen a man named ananias come and place his hands on him to restore his sight  </s>
<s>  lord   ananias answered   i have heard many reports about this man and all the harm he has done to your holy people in jerusalem </s>
<s> and he has come here with authority from the chief priests to arrest all who call on your name  </s>
<s> but the lord said to ananias   go  this man is my chosen instrument to proclaim my name to the gentiles and their kings and to the people of israel </s>
<s> i will show him how much he must suffer for my name  </s>
<s> then ananias went to the house and entered it  placing his hands on saul  he said   brother saul  the lord  jesus  who appeared to you on the road as you were coming here  has sent me so that you may see again and be filled with the holy spirit  </s>
<s> immediately  something like scales fell from sauls eyes  and he could see again  he got up and was baptised </s>
<s> and after taking some food  he regained his strength  saul spent several days with the disciples in damascus </s>
<s> at once he began to preach in the synagogues that jesus is the son of god </s>
<s> all those who heard him were astonished and asked   isnt he the man who caused havoc in jerusalem among those who call on this name  and hasnt he come here to take them as prisoners to the chief priests  </s>
<s> yet saul grew more and more powerful and baffled the jews living in damascus by proving that jesus is the messiah </s>
<s> after many days had gone by  there was a conspiracy among the jews to kill him </s>
<s> but saul learned of their plan  day and night they kept close watch on the city gates in order to kill him </s>
<s> but his followers took him by night and lowered him in a basket through an opening in the wall </s>
<s> when he came to jerusalem  he tried to join the disciples  but they were all afraid of him  not believing that he really was a disciple </s>
<s> but barnabas took him and brought him to the apostles  he told them how saul on his journey had seen the lord and that the lord had spoken to him  and how in damascus he had preached fearlessly in the name of jesus </s>
<s> so saul stayed with them and moved about freely in jerusalem  speaking boldly in the name of the lord </s>
<s> he talked and debated with the hellenistic jews  but they tried to kill him </s>
<s> when the believers learned of this  they took him down to caesarea and sent him off to tarsus </s>
<s> then the church throughout judea  galilee and samaria enjoyed a time of peace and was strengthened  living in the fear of the lord and encouraged by the holy spirit  it increased in numbers </s>
<s> as peter travelled about the country  he went to visit the lords people who lived in lydda </s>
<s> there he found a man named aeneas  who was paralysed and had been bedridden for eight years </s>
<s>  aeneas   peter said to him   jesus christ heals you  get up and roll up your mat   immediately aeneas got up </s>
<s> all those who lived in lydda and sharon saw him and turned to the lord </s>
<s> in joppa there was a disciple named tabitha  in greek her name is dorcas   she was always doing good and helping the poor </s>
<s> about that time she became ill and died  and her body was washed and placed in an upstairs room </s>
<s> lydda was near joppa  so when the disciples heard that peter was in lydda  they sent two men to him and urged him   please come at once  </s>
<s> peter went with them  and when he arrived he was taken upstairs to the room  all the widows stood round him  crying and showing him the robes and other clothing that dorcas had made while she was still with them </s>
<s> peter sent them all out of the room  then he got down on his knees and prayed  turning towards the dead woman  he said   tabitha  get up   she opened her eyes  and seeing peter she sat up </s>
<s> he took her by the hand and helped her to her feet  then he called for the believers  especially the widows  and presented her to them alive </s>
<s> this became known all over joppa  and many people believed in the lord </s>
<s> peter stayed in joppa for some time with a tanner named simon </s>
<s> at caesarea there was a man named cornelius  a centurion in what was known as the italian regiment </s>
<s> he and all his family were devout and godfearing  he gave generously to those in need and prayed to god regularly </s>
<s> one day at about three in the afternoon he had a vision  he distinctly saw an angel of god  who came to him and said   cornelius  </s>
<s> cornelius stared at him in fear   what is it  lord   he asked  the angel answered   your prayers and gifts to the poor have come up as a memorial offering before god </s>
<s> now send men to joppa to bring back a man named simon who is called peter </s>
<s> he is staying with simon the tanner  whose house is by the sea  </s>
<s> when the angel who spoke to him had gone  cornelius called two of his servants and a devout soldier who was one of his attendants </s>
<s> he told them everything that had happened and sent them to joppa </s>
<s> about noon the following day as they were on their journey and approaching the city  peter went up on the roof to pray </s>
<s> he became hungry and wanted something to eat  and while the meal was being prepared  he fell into a trance </s>
<s> he saw heaven opened and something like a large sheet being let down to earth by its four corners </s>
<s> it contained all kinds of fourfooted animals  as well as reptiles and birds </s>
<s> then a voice told him   get up  peter  kill and eat  </s>
<s>  surely not  lord   peter replied   i have never eaten anything impure or unclean  </s>
<s> the voice spoke to him a second time   do not call anything impure that god has made clean  </s>
<s> this happened three times  and immediately the sheet was taken back to heaven </s>
<s> while peter was wondering about the meaning of the vision  the men sent by cornelius found out where simons house was and stopped at the gate </s>
<s> they called out  asking if simon who was known as peter was staying there </s>
<s> while peter was still thinking about the vision  the spirit said to him   simon  three men are looking for you </s>
<s> so get up and go downstairs  do not hesitate to go with them  for i have sent them  </s>
<s> peter went down and said to the men   im the one youre looking for  why have you come  </s>
<s> the men replied   we have come from cornelius the centurion  he is a righteous and godfearing man  who is respected by all the jewish people  a holy angel told him to ask you to come to his house so that he could hear what you have to say  </s>
<s> then peter invited the men into the house to be his guests  the next day peter started out with them  and some of the believers from joppa went along </s>
<s> the following day he arrived in caesarea  cornelius was expecting them and had called together his relatives and close friends </s>
<s> as peter entered the house  cornelius met him and fell at his feet in reverence </s>
<s> but peter made him get up   stand up   he said   i am only a man myself  </s>
<s> while talking with him  peter went inside and found a large gathering of people </s>
<s> he said to them   you are well aware that it is against our law for a jew to associate with or visit a gentile  but god has shown me that i should not call anyone impure or unclean </s>
<s> so when i was sent for  i came without raising any objection  may i ask why you sent for me  </s>
<s> cornelius answered   three days ago i was in my house praying at this hour  at three in the afternoon  suddenly a man in shining clothes stood before me</s>
<s> and said   cornelius  god has heard your prayer and remembered your gifts to the poor </s>
<s> send to joppa for simon who is called peter  he is a guest in the home of simon the tanner  who lives by the sea  </s>
<s> so i sent for you immediately  and it was good of you to come  now we are all here in the presence of god to listen to everything the lord has commanded you to tell us  </s>
<s> then peter began to speak   i now realise how true it is that god does not show favouritism</s>
<s> but accepts from every nation the one who fears him and does what is right </s>
<s> you know the message god sent to the people of israel  announcing the good news of peace through jesus christ  who is lord of all </s>
<s> you know what has happened throughout the province of judea  beginning in galilee after the baptism that john preached </s>
<s> how god anointed jesus of nazareth with the holy spirit and power  and how he went around doing good and healing all who were under the power of the devil  because god was with him </s>
<s>  we are witnesses of everything he did in the country of the jews and in jerusalem  they killed him by hanging him on a cross </s>
<s> but god raised him from the dead on the third day and caused him to be seen </s>
<s> he was not seen by all the people  but by witnesses whom god had already chosen  by us who ate and drank with him after he rose from the dead </s>
<s> he commanded us to preach to the people and to testify that he is the one whom god appointed as judge of the living and the dead </s>
<s> all the prophets testify about him that everyone who believes in him receives forgiveness of sins through his name  </s>
<s> while peter was still speaking these words  the holy spirit came on all who heard the message </s>
<s> the circumcised believers who had come with peter were astonished that the gift of the holy spirit had been poured out even on gentiles </s>
<s> for they heard them speaking in tongues and praising god  then peter said </s>
<s>  surely no one can stand in the way of their being baptised with water  they have received the holy spirit just as we have  </s>
<s> so he ordered that they be baptised in the name of jesus christ  then they asked peter to stay with them for a few days </s>
<s> the apostles and the believers throughout judea heard that the gentiles also had received the word of god </s>
<s> so when peter went up to jerusalem  the circumcised believers criticised him</s>
<s> and said   you went into the house of uncircumcised men and ate with them  </s>
<s> starting from the beginning  peter told them the whole story </s>
<s>  i was in the city of joppa praying  and in a trance i saw a vision  i saw something like a large sheet being let down from heaven by its four corners  and it came down to where i was </s>
<s> i looked into it and saw fourfooted animals of the earth  wild beasts  reptiles and birds </s>
<s> then i heard a voice telling me   get up  peter  kill and eat  </s>
<s>  i replied   surely not  lord  nothing impure or unclean has ever entered my mouth  </s>
<s>  the voice spoke from heaven a second time   do not call anything impure that god has made clean  </s>
<s> this happened three times  and then it was all pulled up to heaven again </s>
<s>  right then three men who had been sent to me from caesarea stopped at the house where i was staying </s>
<s> the spirit told me to have no hesitation about going with them  these six brothers also went with me  and we entered the mans house </s>
<s> he told us how he had seen an angel appear in his house and say   send to joppa for simon who is called peter </s>
<s> he will bring you a message through which you and all your household will be saved  </s>
<s>  as i began to speak  the holy spirit came on them as he had come on us at the beginning </s>
<s> then i remembered what the lord had said   john baptised with water  but you will be baptised with the holy spirit  </s>
<s> so if god gave them the same gift he gave us who believed in the lord jesus christ  who was i to think that i could stand in gods way  </s>
<s> when they heard this  they had no further objections and praised god  saying   so then  even to gentiles god has granted repentance that leads to life  </s>
<s> now those who had been scattered by the persecution that broke out when stephen was killed travelled as far as phoenicia  cyprus and antioch  spreading the word only among jews </s>
<s> some of them  however  men from cyprus and cyrene  went to antioch and began to speak to greeks also  telling them the good news about the lord jesus </s>
<s> the lords hand was with them  and a great number of people believed and turned to the lord </s>
<s> news of this reached the church in jerusalem  and they sent barnabas to antioch </s>
<s> when he arrived and saw what the grace of god had done  he was glad and encouraged them all to remain true to the lord with all their hearts </s>
<s> he was a good man  full of the holy spirit and faith  and a great number of people were brought to the lord </s>
<s> then barnabas went to tarsus to look for saul </s>
<s> and when he found him  he brought him to antioch  so for a whole year barnabas and saul met with the church and taught great numbers of people  the disciples were called christians first at antioch </s>
<s> during this time some prophets came down from jerusalem to antioch </s>
<s> one of them  named agabus  stood up and through the spirit predicted that a severe famine would spread over the entire roman world   this happened during the reign of claudius  </s>
<s> the disciples  as each one was able  decided to provide help for the brothers and sisters living in judea </s>
<s> this they did  sending their gift to the elders by barnabas and saul </s>
<s> it was about this time that king herod arrested some who belonged to the church  intending to persecute them </s>
<s> he had james  the brother of john  put to death with the sword </s>
<s> when he saw that this met with approval among the jews  he proceeded to seize peter also  this happened during the festival of unleavened bread </s>
<s> after arresting him  he put him in prison  handing him over to be guarded by four squads of four soldiers each  herod intended to bring him out for public trial after the passover </s>
<s> so peter was kept in prison  but the church was earnestly praying to god for him </s>
<s> the night before herod was to bring him to trial  peter was sleeping between two soldiers  bound with two chains  and sentries stood guard at the entrance </s>
<s> suddenly an angel of the lord appeared and a light shone in the cell  he struck peter on the side and woke him up   quick  get up   he said  and the chains fell off peters wrists </s>
<s> then the angel said to him   put on your clothes and sandals   and peter did so   wrap your cloak round you and follow me   the angel told him </s>
<s> peter followed him out of the prison  but he had no idea that what the angel was doing was really happening  he thought he was seeing a vision </s>
<s> they passed the first and second guards and came to the iron gate leading to the city  it opened for them by itself  and they went through it  when they had walked the length of one street  suddenly the angel left him </s>
<s> then peter came to himself and said   now i know without a doubt that the lord has sent his angel and rescued me from herods clutches and from everything the jewish people were hoping would happen  </s>
<s> when this had dawned on him  he went to the house of mary the mother of john  also called mark  where many people had gathered and were praying </s>
<s> peter knocked at the outer entrance  and a servant named rhoda came to answer the door </s>
<s> when she recognised peters voice  she was so overjoyed she ran back without opening it and exclaimed   peter is at the door  </s>
<s>  youre out of your mind   they told her  when she kept insisting that it was so  they said   it must be his angel  </s>
<s> but peter kept on knocking  and when they opened the door and saw him  they were astonished </s>
<s> peter motioned with his hand for them to be quiet and described how the lord had brought him out of prison   tell james and the other brothers and sisters about this   he said  and then he left for another place </s>
<s> in the morning  there was no small commotion among the soldiers as to what had become of peter </s>
<s> after herod had a thorough search made for him and did not find him  he crossexamined the guards and ordered that they be executed  then herod went from judea to caesarea and stayed there </s>
<s> he had been quarrelling with the people of tyre and sidon  they now joined together and sought an audience with him  after securing the support of blastus  a trusted personal servant of the king  they asked for peace  because they depended on the kings country for their food supply </s>
<s> on the appointed day herod  wearing his royal robes  sat on his throne and delivered a public address to the people </s>
<s> they shouted   this is the voice of a god  not of a man  </s>
<s> immediately  because herod did not give praise to god  an angel of the lord struck him down  and he was eaten by worms and died </s>
<s> but the word of god continued to spread and flourish </s>
<s> when barnabas and saul had finished their mission  they returned from jerusalem  taking with them john  also called mark </s>
<s> now in the church at antioch there were prophets and teachers  barnabas  simeon called niger  lucius of cyrene  manaen  who had been brought up with herod the tetrarch  and saul </s>
<s> while they were worshipping the lord and fasting  the holy spirit said   set apart for me barnabas and saul for the work to which i have called them  </s>
<s> so after they had fasted and prayed  they placed their hands on them and sent them off </s>
<s> the two of them  sent on their way by the holy spirit  went down to seleucia and sailed from there to cyprus </s>
<s> when they arrived at salamis  they proclaimed the word of god in the jewish synagogues  john was with them as their helper </s>
<s> they travelled through the whole island until they came to paphos  there they met a jewish sorcerer and false prophet named barjesus </s>
<s> who was an attendant of the proconsul  sergius paulus  the proconsul  an intelligent man  sent for barnabas and saul because he wanted to hear the word of god </s>
<s> but elymas the sorcerer  for that is what his name means  opposed them and tried to turn the proconsul from the faith </s>
<s> then saul  who was also called paul  filled with the holy spirit  looked straight at elymas and said </s>
<s>  you are a child of the devil and an enemy of everything that is right  you are full of all kinds of deceit and trickery  will you never stop perverting the right ways of the lord </s>
<s> now the hand of the lord is against you  you are going to be blind for a time  not even able to see the light of the sun   immediately mist and darkness came over him  and he groped about  seeking someone to lead him by the hand </s>
<s> when the proconsul saw what had happened  he believed  for he was amazed at the teaching about the lord </s>
<s> from paphos  paul and his companions sailed to perga in pamphylia  where john left them to return to jerusalem </s>
<s> from perga they went on to pisidian antioch  on the sabbath they entered the synagogue and sat down </s>
<s> after the reading from the law and the prophets  the leaders of the synagogue sent word to them  saying   brothers  if you have a word of exhortation for the people  please speak  </s>
<s> standing up  paul motioned with his hand and said   fellow israelites and you gentiles who worship god  listen to me </s>
<s> the god of the people of israel chose our ancestors  he made the people prosper during their stay in egypt  with mighty power he led them out of that country </s>
<s> for about forty years he endured their conduct in the wilderness </s>
<s> and he overthrew seven nations in canaan  giving their land to his people as their inheritance </s>
<s> all this took about 450 years   after this  god gave them judges until the time of samuel the prophet </s>
<s> then the people asked for a king  and he gave them saul son of kish  of the tribe of benjamin  who ruled for forty years </s>
<s> after removing saul  he made david their king  god testified concerning him   i have found david son of jesse  a man after my own heart  he will do everything i want him to do  </s>
<s>  from this mans descendants god has brought to israel the saviour jesus  as he promised </s>
<s> before the coming of jesus  john preached repentance and baptism to all the people of israel </s>
<s> as john was completing his work  he said   who do you suppose i am  i am not the one you are looking for  but there is one coming after me whose sandals i am not worthy to untie  </s>
<s>  fellow children of abraham and you godfearing gentiles  it is to us that this message of salvation has been sent </s>
<s> the people of jerusalem and their rulers did not recognise jesus  yet in condemning him they fulfilled the words of the prophets that are read every sabbath </s>
<s> though they found no proper ground for a death sentence  they asked pilate to have him executed </s>
<s> when they had carried out all that was written about him  they took him down from the cross and laid him in a tomb </s>
<s> but god raised him from the dead </s>
<s> and for many days he was seen by those who had travelled with him from galilee to jerusalem  they are now his witnesses to our people </s>
<s>  we tell you the good news  what god promised our ancestors</s>
<s> he has fulfilled for us  their children  by raising up jesus  as it is written in the second psalm    you are my son  today i have become your father     i will give you the holy and sure blessings promised to david     you will not let your holy one see decay  </s>
<s>  now when david had served gods purpose in his own generation  he fell asleep  he was buried with his ancestors and his body decayed </s>
<s> but the one whom god raised from the dead did not see decay </s>
<s>  therefore  my friends  i want you to know that through jesus the forgiveness of sins is proclaimed to you </s>
<s> through him everyone who believes is set free from every sin  a justification you were not able to obtain under the law of moses </s>
<s> take care that what the prophets have said does not happen to you </s>
<s>   look  you scoffers  wonder and perish  for i am going to do something in your days that you would never believe  even if someone told you   </s>
<s> as paul and barnabas were leaving the synagogue  the people invited them to speak further about these things on the next sabbath </s>
<s> when the congregation was dismissed  many of the jews and devout converts to judaism followed paul and barnabas  who talked with them and urged them to continue in the grace of god </s>
<s> on the next sabbath almost the whole city gathered to hear the word of the lord </s>
<s> when the jews saw the crowds  they were filled with jealousy  they began to contradict what paul was saying and heaped abuse on him </s>
<s> then paul and barnabas answered them boldly   we had to speak the word of god to you first  since you reject it and do not consider yourselves worthy of eternal life  we now turn to the gentiles </s>
<s> for this is what the lord has commanded us    i have made you a light for the gentiles  that you may bring salvation to the ends of the earth   </s>
<s> when the gentiles heard this  they were glad and honoured the word of the lord  and all who were appointed for eternal life believed </s>
<s> the word of the lord spread through the whole region </s>
<s> but the jewish leaders incited the godfearing women of high standing and the leading men of the city  they stirred up persecution against paul and barnabas  and expelled them from their region </s>
<s> so they shook the dust off their feet as a warning to them and went to iconium </s>
<s> and the disciples were filled with joy and with the holy spirit </s>
<s> at iconium paul and barnabas went as usual into the jewish synagogue  there they spoke so effectively that a great number of jews and greeks believed </s>
<s> but the jews who refused to believe stirred up the other gentiles and poisoned their minds against the brothers </s>
<s> so paul and barnabas spent considerable time there  speaking boldly for the lord  who confirmed the message of his grace by enabling them to perform signs and wonders </s>
<s> the people of the city were divided  some sided with the jews  others with the apostles </s>
<s> there was a plot afoot among both gentiles and jews  together with their leaders  to illtreat them and stone them </s>
<s> but they found out about it and fled to the lycaonian cities of lystra and derbe and to the surrounding country </s>
<s> where they continued to preach the gospel </s>
<s> in lystra there sat a man who was lame  he had been that way from birth and had never walked </s>
<s> he listened to paul as he was speaking  paul looked directly at him  saw that he had faith to be healed</s>
<s> and called out   stand up on your feet   at that  the man jumped up and began to walk </s>
<s> when the crowd saw what paul had done  they shouted in the lycaonian language   the gods have come down to us in human form  </s>
<s> barnabas they called zeus  and paul they called hermes because he was the chief speaker </s>
<s> the priest of zeus  whose temple was just outside the city  brought bulls and wreaths to the city gates because he and the crowd wanted to offer sacrifices to them </s>
<s> but when the apostles barnabas and paul heard of this  they tore their clothes and rushed out into the crowd  shouting </s>
<s>  friends  why are you doing this  we too are only human  like you  we are bringing you good news  telling you to turn from these worthless things to the living god  who made the heavens and the earth and the sea and everything in them </s>
<s> in the past  he let all nations go their own way </s>
<s> yet he has not left himself without testimony  he has shown kindness by giving you rain from heaven and crops in their seasons  he provides you with plenty of food and fills your hearts with joy  </s>
<s> even with these words  they had difficulty keeping the crowd from sacrificing to them </s>
<s> then some jews came from antioch and iconium and won the crowd over  they stoned paul and dragged him outside the city  thinking he was dead </s>
<s> but after the disciples had gathered round him  he got up and went back into the city  the next day he and barnabas left for derbe </s>
<s> they preached the gospel in that city and won a large number of disciples  then they returned to lystra  iconium and antioch </s>
<s> strengthening the disciples and encouraging them to remain true to the faith   we must go through many hardships to enter the kingdom of god   they said </s>
<s> paul and barnabas appointed elders for them in each church and  with prayer and fasting  committed them to the lord  in whom they had put their trust </s>
<s> after going through pisidia  they came into pamphylia </s>
<s> and when they had preached the word in perga  they went down to attalia </s>
<s> from attalia they sailed back to antioch  where they had been committed to the grace of god for the work they had now completed </s>
<s> on arriving there  they gathered the church together and reported all that god had done through them and how he had opened a door of faith to the gentiles </s>
<s> and they stayed there a long time with the disciples </s>
<s> certain people came down from judea to antioch and were teaching the believers   unless you are circumcised  according to the custom taught by moses  you cannot be saved  </s>
<s> this brought paul and barnabas into sharp dispute and debate with them  so paul and barnabas were appointed  along with some other believers  to go up to jerusalem to see the apostles and elders about this question </s>
<s> the church sent them on their way  and as they travelled through phoenicia and samaria  they told how the gentiles had been converted  this news made all the believers very glad </s>
<s> when they came to jerusalem  they were welcomed by the church and the apostles and elders  to whom they reported everything god had done through them </s>
<s> then some of the believers who belonged to the party of the pharisees stood up and said   the gentiles must be circumcised and required to keep the law of moses  </s>
<s> the apostles and elders met to consider this question </s>
<s> after much discussion  peter got up and addressed them   brothers  you know that some time ago god made a choice among you that the gentiles should hear from my lips the message of the gospel and believe </s>
<s> god  who knows the heart  showed that he accepted them by giving the holy spirit to them  just as he did to us </s>
<s> he did not discriminate between us and them  for he purified their hearts by faith </s>
<s> now then  why do you try to test god by putting on the necks of gentiles a yoke that neither we nor our ancestors have been able to bear </s>
<s> no  we believe it is through the grace of our lord jesus that we are saved  just as they are  </s>
<s> the whole assembly became silent as they listened to barnabas and paul telling about the signs and wonders god had done among the gentiles through them </s>
<s> when they finished  james spoke up   brothers   he said   listen to me </s>
<s> simon has described to us how god first intervened to choose a people for his name from the gentiles </s>
<s> the words of the prophets are in agreement with this  as it is written </s>
<s>   after this i will return and rebuild davids fallen tent  its ruins i will rebuild  and i will restore it </s>
<s> that the rest of mankind may seek the lord  even all the gentiles who bear my name  says the lord  who does these things  </s>
<s> things known from long ago </s>
<s>  it is my judgment  therefore  that we should not make it difficult for the gentiles who are turning to god </s>
<s> instead we should write to them  telling them to abstain from food polluted by idols  from sexual immorality  from the meat of strangled animals and from blood </s>
<s> for the law of moses has been preached in every city from the earliest times and is read in the synagogues on every sabbath  </s>
<s> then the apostles and elders  with the whole church  decided to choose some of their own men and send them to antioch with paul and barnabas  they chose judas  called barsabbas  and silas  men who were leaders among the believers </s>
<s> with them they sent the following letter </s>
<s> so the men were sent off and went down to antioch  where they gathered the church together and delivered the letter </s>
<s> the people read it and were glad for its encouraging message </s>
<s> judas and silas  who themselves were prophets  said much to encourage and strengthen the believers </s>
<s> after spending some time there  they were sent off by the believers with the blessing of peace to return to those who had sent them  </s>
<s> </s>
<s> but paul and barnabas remained in antioch  where they and many others taught and preached the word of the lord </s>
<s> some time later paul said to barnabas   let us go back and visit the believers in all the towns where we preached the word of the lord and see how they are doing  </s>
<s> barnabas wanted to take john  also called mark  with them </s>
<s> but paul did not think it wise to take him  because he had deserted them in pamphylia and had not continued with them in the work </s>
<s> they had such a sharp disagreement that they parted company  barnabas took mark and sailed for cyprus </s>
<s> but paul chose silas and left  commended by the believers to the grace of the lord </s>
<s> he went through syria and cilicia  strengthening the churches </s>
<s> paul came to derbe and then to lystra  where a disciple named timothy lived  whose mother was jewish and a believer but whose father was a greek </s>
<s> the believers at lystra and iconium spoke well of him </s>
<s> paul wanted to take him along on the journey  so he circumcised him because of the jews who lived in that area  for they all knew that his father was a greek </s>
<s> as they travelled from town to town  they delivered the decisions reached by the apostles and elders in jerusalem for the people to obey </s>
<s> so the churches were strengthened in the faith and grew daily in numbers </s>
<s> paul and his companions travelled throughout the region of phrygia and galatia  having been kept by the holy spirit from preaching the word in the province of asia </s>
<s> when they came to the border of mysia  they tried to enter bithynia  but the spirit of jesus would not allow them to </s>
<s> so they passed by mysia and went down to troas </s>
<s> during the night paul had a vision of a man of macedonia standing and begging him   come over to macedonia and help us  </s>
<s> after paul had seen the vision  we got ready at once to leave for macedonia  concluding that god had called us to preach the gospel to them </s>
<s> from troas we put out to sea and sailed straight for samothrace  and the next day we went on to neapolis </s>
<s> from there we travelled to philippi  a roman colony and the leading city of that district of macedonia  and we stayed there several days </s>
<s> on the sabbath we went outside the city gate to the river  where we expected to find a place of prayer  we sat down and began to speak to the women who had gathered there </s>
<s> one of those listening was a woman from the city of thyatira named lydia  a dealer in purple cloth  she was a worshipper of god  the lord opened her heart to respond to pauls message </s>
<s> when she and the members of her household were baptised  she invited us to her home   if you consider me a believer in the lord   she said   come and stay at my house   and she persuaded us </s>
<s> once when we were going to the place of prayer  we were met by a female slave who had a spirit by which she predicted the future  she earned a great deal of money for her owners by fortunetelling </s>
<s> she followed paul and the rest of us  shouting   these men are servants of the most high god  who are telling you the way to be saved  </s>
<s> she kept this up for many days  finally paul became so annoyed that he turned round and said to the spirit   in the name of jesus christ i command you to come out of her   at that moment the spirit left her </s>
<s> when her owners realised that their hope of making money was gone  they seized paul and silas and dragged them into the marketplace to face the authorities </s>
<s> they brought them before the magistrates and said   these men are jews  and are throwing our city into an uproar</s>
<s> by advocating customs unlawful for us romans to accept or practise  </s>
<s> the crowd joined in the attack against paul and silas  and the magistrates ordered them to be stripped and beaten with rods </s>
<s> after they had been severely flogged  they were thrown into prison  and the jailer was commanded to guard them carefully </s>
<s> when he received these orders  he put them in the inner cell and fastened their feet in the stocks </s>
<s> about midnight paul and silas were praying and singing hymns to god  and the other prisoners were listening to them </s>
<s> suddenly there was such a violent earthquake that the foundations of the prison were shaken  at once all the prison doors flew open  and everyones chains came loose </s>
<s> the jailer woke up  and when he saw the prison doors open  he drew his sword and was about to kill himself because he thought the prisoners had escaped </s>
<s> but paul shouted   dont harm yourself  we are all here  </s>
<s> the jailer called for lights  rushed in and fell trembling before paul and silas </s>
<s> he then brought them out and asked   sirs  what must i do to be saved  </s>
<s> they replied   believe in the lord jesus  and you will be saved  you and your household  </s>
<s> then they spoke the word of the lord to him and to all the others in his house </s>
<s> at that hour of the night the jailer took them and washed their wounds  then immediately he and all his household were baptised </s>
<s> the jailer brought them into his house and set a meal before them  he was filled with joy because he had come to believe in god  he and his whole household </s>
<s> when it was daylight  the magistrates sent their officers to the jailer with the order   release those men  </s>
<s> the jailer told paul   the magistrates have ordered that you and silas be released  now you can leave  go in peace  </s>
<s> but paul said to the officers   they beat us publicly without a trial  even though we are roman citizens  and threw us into prison  and now do they want to get rid of us quietly  no  let them come themselves and escort us out  </s>
<s> the officers reported this to the magistrates  and when they heard that paul and silas were roman citizens  they were alarmed </s>
<s> they came to appease them and escorted them from the prison  requesting them to leave the city </s>
<s> after paul and silas came out of the prison  they went to lydias house  where they met with the brothers and sisters and encouraged them  then they left </s>
<s> when paul and his companions had passed through amphipolis and apollonia  they came to thessalonica  where there was a jewish synagogue </s>
<s> as was his custom  paul went into the synagogue  and on three sabbath days he reasoned with them from the scriptures </s>
<s> explaining and proving that the messiah had to suffer and rise from the dead   this jesus i am proclaiming to you is the messiah   he said </s>
<s> some of the jews were persuaded and joined paul and silas  as did a large number of godfearing greeks and quite a few prominent women </s>
<s> but other jews were jealous  so they rounded up some bad characters from the marketplace  formed a mob and started a riot in the city  they rushed to jasons house in search of paul and silas in order to bring them out to the crowd </s>
<s> but when they did not find them  they dragged jason and some other believers before the city officials  shouting   these men who have caused trouble all over the world have now come here </s>
<s> and jason has welcomed them into his house  they are all defying caesars decrees  saying that there is another king  one called jesus  </s>
<s> when they heard this  the crowd and the city officials were thrown into turmoil </s>
<s> then they put jason and the others on bail and let them go </s>
<s> as soon as it was night  the believers sent paul and silas away to berea  on arriving there  they went to the jewish synagogue </s>
<s> now the berean jews were of more noble character than those in thessalonica  for they received the message with great eagerness and examined the scriptures every day to see if what paul said was true </s>
<s> as a result  many of them believed  as did also a number of prominent greek women and many greek men </s>
<s> but when the jews in thessalonica learned that paul was preaching the word of god at berea  some of them went there too  agitating the crowds and stirring them up </s>
<s> the believers immediately sent paul to the coast  but silas and timothy stayed at berea </s>
<s> those who escorted paul brought him to athens and then left with instructions for silas and timothy to join him as soon as possible </s>
<s> while paul was waiting for them in athens  he was greatly distressed to see that the city was full of idols </s>
<s> so he reasoned in the synagogue with both jews and godfearing greeks  as well as in the marketplace day by day with those who happened to be there </s>
<s> a group of epicurean and stoic philosophers began to debate with him  some of them asked   what is this babbler trying to say   others remarked   he seems to be advocating foreign gods   they said this because paul was preaching the good news about jesus and the resurrection </s>
<s> then they took him and brought him to a meeting of the areopagus  where they said to him   may we know what this new teaching is that you are presenting </s>
<s> you are bringing some strange ideas to our ears  and we would like to know what they mean  </s>
<s>  all the athenians and the foreigners who lived there spent their time doing nothing but talking about and listening to the latest ideas  </s>
<s> paul then stood up in the meeting of the areopagus and said   people of athens  i see that in every way you are very religious </s>
<s> for as i walked around and looked carefully at your objects of worship  i even found an altar with this inscription  to an unknown god  so you are ignorant of the very thing you worship  and this is what i am going to proclaim to you </s>
<s>  the god who made the world and everything in it is the lord of heaven and earth and does not live in temples built by human hands </s>
<s> and he is not served by human hands  as if he needed anything  rather  he himself gives everyone life and breath and everything else </s>
<s> from one man he made all the nations  that they should inhabit the whole earth  and he marked out their appointed times in history and the boundaries of their lands </s>
<s> god did this so that they would seek him and perhaps reach out for him and find him  though he is not far from any one of us </s>
<s>  for in him we live and move and have our being   as some of your own poets have said   we are his offspring  </s>
<s>  therefore since we are gods offspring  we should not think that the divine being is like gold or silver or stone  an image made by human design and skill </s>
<s> in the past god overlooked such ignorance  but now he commands all people everywhere to repent </s>
<s> for he has set a day when he will judge the world with justice by the man he has appointed  he has given proof of this to everyone by raising him from the dead  </s>
<s> when they heard about the resurrection of the dead  some of them sneered  but others said   we want to hear you again on this subject  </s>
<s> at that  paul left the council </s>
<s> some of the people became followers of paul and believed  among them was dionysius  a member of the areopagus  also a woman named damaris  and a number of others </s>
<s> after this  paul left athens and went to corinth </s>
<s> there he met a jew named aquila  a native of pontus  who had recently come from italy with his wife priscilla  because claudius had ordered all jews to leave rome  paul went to see them </s>
<s> and because he was a tentmaker as they were  he stayed and worked with them </s>
<s> every sabbath he reasoned in the synagogue  trying to persuade jews and greeks </s>
<s> when silas and timothy came from macedonia  paul devoted himself exclusively to preaching  testifying to the jews that jesus was the messiah </s>
<s> but when they opposed paul and became abusive  he shook out his clothes in protest and said to them   your blood be on your own heads  i am innocent of it  from now on i will go to the gentiles  </s>
<s> then paul left the synagogue and went next door to the house of titius justus  a worshipper of god </s>
<s> crispus  the synagogue leader  and his entire household believed in the lord  and many of the corinthians who heard paul believed and were baptised </s>
<s> one night the lord spoke to paul in a vision   do not be afraid  keep on speaking  do not be silent </s>
<s> for i am with you  and no one is going to attack and harm you  because i have many people in this city  </s>
<s> so paul stayed in corinth for a year and a half  teaching them the word of god </s>
<s> while gallio was proconsul of achaia  the jews of corinth made a united attack on paul and brought him to the place of judgment </s>
<s>  this man   they charged   is persuading the people to worship god in ways contrary to the law  </s>
<s> just as paul was about to speak  gallio said to them   if you jews were making a complaint about some misdemeanour or serious crime  it would be reasonable for me to listen to you </s>
<s> but since it involves questions about words and names and your own law  settle the matter yourselves  i will not be a judge of such things  </s>
<s> so he drove them off </s>
<s> then the crowd there turned on sosthenes the synagogue leader and beat him in front of the proconsul  and gallio showed no concern whatever </s>
<s> paul stayed on in corinth for some time  then he left the brothers and sisters and sailed for syria  accompanied by priscilla and aquila  before he sailed  he had his hair cut off at cenchreae because of a vow he had taken </s>
<s> they arrived at ephesus  where paul left priscilla and aquila  he himself went into the synagogue and reasoned with the jews </s>
<s> when they asked him to spend more time with them  he declined </s>
<s> but as he left  he promised   i will come back if it is gods will   then he set sail from ephesus </s>
<s> when he landed at caesarea  he went up to jerusalem and greeted the church and then went down to antioch </s>
<s> after spending some time in antioch  paul set out from there and travelled from place to place throughout the region of galatia and phrygia  strengthening all the disciples </s>
<s> meanwhile a jew named apollos  a native of alexandria  came to ephesus  he was a learned man  with a thorough knowledge of the scriptures </s>
<s> he had been instructed in the way of the lord  and he spoke with great fervour and taught about jesus accurately  though he knew only the baptism of john </s>
<s> he began to speak boldly in the synagogue  when priscilla and aquila heard him  they invited him to their home and explained to him the way of god more adequately </s>
<s> when apollos wanted to go to achaia  the brothers and sisters encouraged him and wrote to the disciples there to welcome him  when he arrived  he was a great help to those who by grace had believed </s>
<s> for he vigorously refuted his jewish opponents in public debate  proving from the scriptures that jesus was the messiah </s>
<s> while apollos was at corinth  paul took the road through the interior and arrived at ephesus  there he found some disciples</s>
<s> and asked them   did you receive the holy spirit when you believed   they answered   no  we have not even heard that there is a holy spirit  </s>
<s> so paul asked   then what baptism did you receive    johns baptism   they replied </s>
<s> paul said   johns baptism was a baptism of repentance  he told the people to believe in the one coming after him  that is  in jesus  </s>
<s> on hearing this  they were baptised in the name of the lord jesus </s>
<s> when paul placed his hands on them  the holy spirit came on them  and they spoke in tongues and prophesied </s>
<s> there were about twelve men in all </s>
<s> paul entered the synagogue and spoke boldly there for three months  arguing persuasively about the kingdom of god </s>
<s> but some of them became obstinate  they refused to believe and publicly maligned the way  so paul left them  he took the disciples with him and had discussions daily in the lecture hall of tyrannus </s>
<s> this went on for two years  so that all the jews and greeks who lived in the province of asia heard the word of the lord </s>
<s> god did extraordinary miracles through paul </s>
<s> so that even handkerchiefs and aprons that had touched him were taken to those who were ill  and their illnesses were cured and the evil spirits left them </s>
<s> some jews who went around driving out evil spirits tried to invoke the name of the lord jesus over those who were demonpossessed  they would say   in the name of the jesus whom paul preaches  i command you to come out  </s>
<s> seven sons of sceva  a jewish chief priest  were doing this </s>
<s> one day the evil spirit answered them   jesus i know  and paul i know about  but who are you  </s>
<s> then the man who had the evil spirit jumped on them and overpowered them all  he gave them such a beating that they ran out of the house naked and bleeding </s>
<s> when this became known to the jews and greeks living in ephesus  they were all seized with fear  and the name of the lord jesus was held in high honour </s>
<s> many of those who believed now came and openly confessed what they had done </s>
<s> a number who had practised sorcery brought their scrolls together and burned them publicly  when they calculated the value of the scrolls  the total came to fifty thousand drachmas </s>
<s> in this way the word of the lord spread widely and grew in power </s>
<s> after all this had happened  paul decided to go to jerusalem  passing through macedonia and achaia   after i have been there   he said   i must visit rome also  </s>
<s> he sent two of his helpers  timothy and erastus  to macedonia  while he stayed in the province of asia a little longer </s>
<s> about that time there arose a great disturbance about the way </s>
<s> a silversmith named demetrius  who made silver shrines of artemis  brought in a lot of business for the craftsmen there </s>
<s> he called them together  along with the workers in related trades  and said   you know  my friends  that we receive a good income from this business </s>
<s> and you see and hear how this fellow paul has convinced and led astray large numbers of people here in ephesus and in practically the whole province of asia  he says that gods made by human hands are no gods at all </s>
<s> there is danger not only that our trade will lose its good name  but also that the temple of the great goddess artemis will be discredited  and the goddess herself  who is worshipped throughout the province of asia and the world  will be robbed of her divine majesty  </s>
<s> when they heard this  they were furious and began shouting   great is artemis of the ephesians  </s>
<s> soon the whole city was in an uproar  the people seized gaius and aristarchus  pauls travelling companions from macedonia  and all of them rushed into the theatre together </s>
<s> paul wanted to appear before the crowd  but the disciples would not let him </s>
<s> even some of the officials of the province  friends of paul  sent him a message begging him not to venture into the theatre </s>
<s> the assembly was in confusion  some were shouting one thing  some another  most of the people did not even know why they were there </s>
<s> the jews in the crowd pushed alexander to the front  and they shouted instructions to him  he motioned for silence in order to make a defence before the people </s>
<s> but when they realised he was a jew  they all shouted in unison for about two hours   great is artemis of the ephesians  </s>
<s> the city clerk quietened the crowd and said   fellow ephesians  doesnt all the world know that the city of ephesus is the guardian of the temple of the great artemis and of her image  which fell from heaven </s>
<s> therefore  since these facts are undeniable  you ought to calm down and not do anything rash </s>
<s> you have brought these men here  though they have neither robbed temples nor blasphemed our goddess </s>
<s> if  then  demetrius and his fellow craftsmen have a grievance against anybody  the courts are open and there are proconsuls  they can press charges </s>
<s> if there is anything further you want to bring up  it must be settled in a legal assembly </s>
<s> as it is  we are in danger of being charged with rioting because of what happened today  in that case we would not be able to account for this commotion  since there is no reason for it  </s>
<s> after he had said this  he dismissed the assembly </s>
<s> when the uproar had ended  paul sent for the disciples and  after encouraging them  said goodbye and set out for macedonia </s>
<s> he travelled through that area  speaking many words of encouragement to the people  and finally arrived in greece </s>
<s> where he stayed three months  because some jews had plotted against him just as he was about to sail for syria  he decided to go back through macedonia </s>
<s> he was accompanied by sopater son of pyrrhus from berea  aristarchus and secundus from thessalonica  gaius from derbe  timothy also  and tychicus and trophimus from the province of asia </s>
<s> these men went on ahead and waited for us at troas </s>
<s> but we sailed from philippi after the festival of unleavened bread  and five days later joined the others at troas  where we stayed seven days </s>
<s> on the first day of the week we came together to break bread  paul spoke to the people and  because he intended to leave the next day  kept on talking until midnight </s>
<s> there were many lamps in the upstairs room where we were meeting </s>
<s> seated in a window was a young man named eutychus  who was sinking into a deep sleep as paul talked on and on  when he was sound asleep  he fell to the ground from the third storey and was picked up dead </s>
<s> paul went down  threw himself on the young man and put his arms round him   dont be alarmed   he said   hes alive  </s>
<s> then he went upstairs again and broke bread and ate  after talking until daylight  he left </s>
<s> the people took the young man home alive and were greatly comforted </s>
<s> we went on ahead to the ship and sailed for assos  where we were going to take paul aboard  he had made this arrangement because he was going there on foot </s>
<s> when he met us at assos  we took him aboard and went on to mitylene </s>
<s> the next day we set sail from there and arrived off chios  the day after that we crossed over to samos  and on the following day arrived at miletus </s>
<s> paul had decided to sail past ephesus to avoid spending time in the province of asia  for he was in a hurry to reach jerusalem  if possible  by the day of pentecost </s>
<s> from miletus  paul sent to ephesus for the elders of the church </s>
<s> when they arrived  he said to them   you know how i lived the whole time i was with you  from the first day i came into the province of asia </s>
<s> i served the lord with great humility and with tears and in the midst of severe testing by the plots of my jewish opponents </s>
<s> you know that i have not hesitated to preach anything that would be helpful to you but have taught you publicly and from house to house </s>
<s> i have declared to both jews and greeks that they must turn to god in repentance and have faith in our lord jesus </s>
<s>  and now  compelled by the spirit  i am going to jerusalem  not knowing what will happen to me there </s>
<s> i only know that in every city the holy spirit warns me that prison and hardships are facing me </s>
<s> however  i consider my life worth nothing to me  my only aim is to finish the race and complete the task the lord jesus has given me  the task of testifying to the good news of gods grace </s>
<s>  now i know that none of you among whom i have gone about preaching the kingdom will ever see me again </s>
<s> therefore  i declare to you today that i am innocent of the blood of any of you </s>
<s> for i have not hesitated to proclaim to you the whole will of god </s>
<s> keep watch over yourselves and all the flock of which the holy spirit has made you overseers  be shepherds of the church of god  which he bought with his own blood </s>
<s> i know that after i leave  savage wolves will come in among you and will not spare the flock </s>
<s> even from your own number men will arise and distort the truth in order to draw away disciples after them </s>
<s> so be on your guard  remember that for three years i never stopped warning each of you night and day with tears </s>
<s>  now i commit you to god and to the word of his grace  which can build you up and give you an inheritance among all those who are sanctified </s>
<s> i have not coveted anyones silver or gold or clothing </s>
<s> you yourselves know that these hands of mine have supplied my own needs and the needs of my companions </s>
<s> in everything i did  i showed you that by this kind of hard work we must help the weak  remembering the words the lord jesus himself said   it is more blessed to give than to receive   </s>
<s> when paul had finished speaking  he knelt down with all of them and prayed </s>
<s> they all wept as they embraced him and kissed him </s>
<s> what grieved them most was his statement that they would never see his face again  then they accompanied him to the ship </s>
<s> after we had torn ourselves away from them  we put out to sea and sailed straight to kos  the next day we went to rhodes and from there to patara </s>
<s> we found a ship crossing over to phoenicia  went on board and set sail </s>
<s> after sighting cyprus and passing to the south of it  we sailed on to syria  we landed at tyre  where our ship was to unload its cargo </s>
<s> we sought out the disciples there and stayed with them seven days  through the spirit they urged paul not to go on to jerusalem </s>
<s> when it was time to leave  we left and continued on our way  all of them  including wives and children  accompanied us out of the city  and there on the beach we knelt to pray </s>
<s> after saying goodbye to each other  we went aboard the ship  and they returned home </s>
<s> we continued our voyage from tyre and landed at ptolemais  where we greeted the brothers and sisters and stayed with them for a day </s>
<s> leaving the next day  we reached caesarea and stayed at the house of philip the evangelist  one of the seven </s>
<s> he had four unmarried daughters who prophesied </s>
<s> after we had been there a number of days  a prophet named agabus came down from judea </s>
<s> coming over to us  he took pauls belt  tied his own hands and feet with it and said   the holy spirit says   in this way the jewish leaders in jerusalem will bind the owner of this belt and will hand him over to the gentiles   </s>
<s> when we heard this  we and the people there pleaded with paul not to go up to jerusalem </s>
<s> then paul answered   why are you weeping and breaking my heart  i am ready not only to be bound  but also to die in jerusalem for the name of the lord jesus  </s>
<s> when he would not be dissuaded  we gave up and said   the lords will be done  </s>
<s> after this  we started on our way up to jerusalem </s>
<s> some of the disciples from caesarea accompanied us and brought us to the home of mnason  where we were to stay  he was a man from cyprus and one of the early disciples </s>
<s> when we arrived at jerusalem  the brothers and sisters received us warmly </s>
<s> the next day paul and the rest of us went to see james  and all the elders were present </s>
<s> paul greeted them and reported in detail what god had done among the gentiles through his ministry </s>
<s> when they heard this  they praised god  then they said to paul   you see  brother  how many thousands of jews have believed  and all of them are zealous for the law </s>
<s> they have been informed that you teach all the jews who live among the gentiles to turn away from moses  telling them not to circumcise their children or live according to our customs </s>
<s> what shall we do  they will certainly hear that you have come </s>
<s> so do what we tell you  there are four men with us who have made a vow </s>
<s> take these men  join in their purification rites and pay their expenses  so that they can have their heads shaved  then everyone will know there is no truth in these reports about you  but that you yourself are living in obedience to the law </s>
<s> as for the gentile believers  we have written to them our decision that they should abstain from food sacrificed to idols  from blood  from the meat of strangled animals and from sexual immorality  </s>
<s> the next day paul took the men and purified himself along with them  then he went to the temple to give notice of the date when the days of purification would end and the offering would be made for each of them </s>
<s> when the seven days were nearly over  some jews from the province of asia saw paul at the temple  they stirred up the whole crowd and seized him </s>
<s> shouting   fellow israelites  help us  this is the man who teaches everyone everywhere against our people and our law and this place  and besides  he has brought greeks into the temple and defiled this holy place  </s>
<s>  they had previously seen trophimus the ephesian in the city with paul and assumed that paul had brought him into the temple  </s>
<s> the whole city was aroused  and the people came running from all directions  seizing paul  they dragged him from the temple  and immediately the gates were shut </s>
<s> while they were trying to kill him  news reached the commander of the roman troops that the whole city of jerusalem was in an uproar </s>
<s> he at once took some officers and soldiers and ran down to the crowd  when the rioters saw the commander and his soldiers  they stopped beating paul </s>
<s> the commander came up and arrested him and ordered him to be bound with two chains  then he asked who he was and what he had done </s>
<s> some in the crowd shouted one thing and some another  and since the commander could not get at the truth because of the uproar  he ordered that paul be taken into the barracks </s>
<s> when paul reached the steps  the violence of the mob was so great he had to be carried by the soldiers </s>
<s> the crowd that followed kept shouting   get rid of him  </s>
<s> as the soldiers were about to take paul into the barracks  he asked the commander   may i say something to you    do you speak greek   he replied </s>
<s>  arent you the egyptian who started a revolt and led four thousand terrorists out into the wilderness some time ago  </s>
<s> paul answered   i am a jew  from tarsus in cilicia  a citizen of no ordinary city  please let me speak to the people  </s>
<s> after receiving the commanders permission  paul stood on the steps and motioned to the crowd  when they were all silent  he said to them in aramaic </s>
<s>  brothers and fathers  listen now to my defence  </s>
<s> when they heard him speak to them in aramaic  they became very quiet  then paul said </s>
<s>  i am a jew  born in tarsus of cilicia  but brought up in this city  i studied under gamaliel and was thoroughly trained in the law of our ancestors  i was just as zealous for god as any of you are today </s>
<s> i persecuted the followers of this way to their death  arresting both men and women and throwing them into prison </s>
<s> as the high priest and all the council can themselves testify  i even obtained letters from them to their associates in damascus  and went there to bring these people as prisoners to jerusalem to be punished </s>
<s>  about noon as i came near damascus  suddenly a bright light from heaven flashed around me </s>
<s> i fell to the ground and heard a voice say to me   saul  saul  why do you persecute me  </s>
<s>   who are you  lord   i asked    i am jesus of nazareth  whom you are persecuting   he replied </s>
<s> my companions saw the light  but they did not understand the voice of him who was speaking to me </s>
<s>   what shall i do  lord   i asked    get up   the lord said   and go into damascus  there you will be told all that you have been assigned to do  </s>
<s> my companions led me by the hand into damascus  because the brilliance of the light had blinded me </s>
<s>  a man named ananias came to see me  he was a devout observer of the law and highly respected by all the jews living there </s>
<s> he stood beside me and said   brother saul  receive your sight   and at that very moment i was able to see him </s>
<s>  then he said   the god of our ancestors has chosen you to know his will and to see the righteous one and to hear words from his mouth </s>
<s> you will be his witness to all people of what you have seen and heard </s>
<s> and now what are you waiting for  get up  be baptised and wash your sins away  calling on his name  </s>
<s>  when i returned to jerusalem and was praying at the temple  i fell into a trance</s>
<s> and saw the lord speaking to me   quick   he said   leave jerusalem immediately  because the people here will not accept your testimony about me  </s>
<s>   lord   i replied   these people know that i went from one synagogue to another to imprison and beat those who believe in you </s>
<s> and when the blood of your martyr stephen was shed  i stood there giving my approval and guarding the clothes of those who were killing him  </s>
<s>  then the lord said to me   go  i will send you far away to the gentiles   </s>
<s> the crowd listened to paul until he said this  then they raised their voices and shouted   rid the earth of him  hes not fit to live  </s>
<s> as they were shouting and throwing off their cloaks and flinging dust into the air </s>
<s> the commander ordered that paul be taken into the barracks  he directed that he be flogged and interrogated in order to find out why the people were shouting at him like this </s>
<s> as they stretched him out to flog him  paul said to the centurion standing there   is it legal for you to flog a roman citizen who hasnt even been found guilty  </s>
<s> when the centurion heard this  he went to the commander and reported it   what are you going to do   he asked   this man is a roman citizen  </s>
<s> the commander went to paul and asked   tell me  are you a roman citizen    yes  i am   he answered </s>
<s> then the commander said   i had to pay a lot of money for my citizenship    but i was born a citizen   paul replied </s>
<s> those who were about to interrogate him withdrew immediately  the commander himself was alarmed when he realised that he had put paul  a roman citizen  in chains </s>
<s> the commander wanted to find out exactly why paul was being accused by the jews  so the next day he released him and ordered the chief priests and all the members of the sanhedrin to assemble  then he brought paul and set him before them </s>
<s> paul looked straight at the sanhedrin and said   my brothers  i have fulfilled my duty to god in all good conscience to this day  </s>
<s> at this the high priest ananias ordered those standing near paul to strike him on the mouth </s>
<s> then paul said to him   god will strike you  you whitewashed wall  you sit there to judge me according to the law  yet you yourself violate the law by commanding that i be struck  </s>
<s> those who were standing near paul said   how dare you insult gods high priest  </s>
<s> paul replied   brothers  i did not realise that he was the high priest  for it is written   do not speak evil about the ruler of your people   </s>
<s> then paul  knowing that some of them were sadducees and the others pharisees  called out in the sanhedrin   my brothers  i am a pharisee  descended from pharisees  i stand on trial because of the hope of the resurrection of the dead  </s>
<s> when he said this  a dispute broke out between the pharisees and the sadducees  and the assembly was divided </s>
<s>  the sadducees say that there is no resurrection  and that there are neither angels nor spirits  but the pharisees believe all these things  </s>
<s> there was a great uproar  and some of the teachers of the law who were pharisees stood up and argued vigorously   we find nothing wrong with this man   they said   what if a spirit or an angel has spoken to him  </s>
<s> the dispute became so violent that the commander was afraid paul would be torn to pieces by them  he ordered the troops to go down and take him away from them by force and bring him into the barracks </s>
<s> the following night the lord stood near paul and said   take courage  as you have testified about me in jerusalem  so you must also testify in rome  </s>
<s> the next morning some jews formed a conspiracy and bound themselves with an oath not to eat or drink until they had killed paul </s>
<s> more than forty men were involved in this plot </s>
<s> they went to the chief priests and the elders and said   we have taken a solemn oath not to eat anything until we have killed paul </s>
<s> now then  you and the sanhedrin petition the commander to bring him before you on the pretext of wanting more accurate information about his case  we are ready to kill him before he gets here  </s>
<s> but when the son of pauls sister heard of this plot  he went into the barracks and told paul </s>
<s> then paul called one of the centurions and said   take this young man to the commander  he has something to tell him  </s>
<s> so he took him to the commander  the centurion said   paul  the prisoner  sent for me and asked me to bring this young man to you because he has something to tell you  </s>
<s> the commander took the young man by the hand  drew him aside and asked   what is it you want to tell me  </s>
<s> he said   some jews have agreed to ask you to bring paul before the sanhedrin tomorrow on the pretext of wanting more accurate information about him </s>
<s> dont give in to them  because more than forty of them are waiting in ambush for him  they have taken an oath not to eat or drink until they have killed him  they are ready now  waiting for your consent to their request  </s>
<s> the commander dismissed the young man with this warning   dont tell anyone that you have reported this to me  </s>
<s> then he called two of his centurions and ordered them   get ready a detachment of two hundred soldiers  seventy horsemen and two hundred spearmen to go to caesarea at nine tonight </s>
<s> provide horses for paul so that he may be taken safely to governor felix  </s>
<s> he wrote a letter as follows </s>
<s> so the soldiers  carrying out their orders  took paul with them during the night and brought him as far as antipatris </s>
<s> the next day they let the cavalry go on with him  while they returned to the barracks </s>
<s> when the cavalry arrived in caesarea  they delivered the letter to the governor and handed paul over to him </s>
<s> the governor read the letter and asked what province he was from  learning that he was from cilicia </s>
<s> he said   i will hear your case when your accusers get here   then he ordered that paul be kept under guard in herods palace </s>
<s> five days later the high priest ananias went down to caesarea with some of the elders and a lawyer named tertullus  and they brought their charges against paul before the governor </s>
<s> when paul was called in  tertullus presented his case before felix   we have enjoyed a long period of peace under you  and your foresight has brought about reforms in this nation </s>
<s> everywhere and in every way  most excellent felix  we acknowledge this with profound gratitude </s>
<s> but in order not to weary you further  i would request that you be kind enough to hear us briefly </s>
<s>  we have found this man to be a troublemaker  stirring up riots among the jews all over the world  he is a ringleader of the nazarene sect</s>
<s> and even tried to desecrate the temple  so we seized him  </s>
<s> </s>
<s> by examining him yourself you will be able to learn the truth about all these charges we are bringing against him  </s>
<s> the other jews joined in the accusation  asserting that these things were true </s>
<s> when the governor motioned for him to speak  paul replied   i know that for a number of years you have been a judge over this nation  so i gladly make my defence </s>
<s> you can easily verify that no more than twelve days ago i went up to jerusalem to worship </s>
<s> my accusers did not find me arguing with anyone at the temple  or stirring up a crowd in the synagogues or anywhere else in the city </s>
<s> and they cannot prove to you the charges they are now making against me </s>
<s> however  i admit that i worship the god of our ancestors as a follower of the way  which they call a sect  i believe everything that is in accordance with the law and that is written in the prophets </s>
<s> and i have the same hope in god as these men themselves have  that there will be a resurrection of both the righteous and the wicked </s>
<s> so i strive always to keep my conscience clear before god and man </s>
<s>  after an absence of several years  i came to jerusalem to bring my people gifts for the poor and to present offerings </s>
<s> i was ceremonially clean when they found me in the temple courts doing this  there was no crowd with me  nor was i involved in any disturbance </s>
<s> but there are some jews from the province of asia  who ought to be here before you and bring charges if they have anything against me </s>
<s> or these who are here should state what crime they found in me when i stood before the sanhedrin </s>
<s> unless it was this one thing i shouted as i stood in their presence   it is concerning the resurrection of the dead that i am on trial before you today   </s>
<s> then felix  who was well acquainted with the way  adjourned the proceedings   when lysias the commander comes   he said   i will decide your case  </s>
<s> he ordered the centurion to keep paul under guard but to give him some freedom and permit his friends to take care of his needs </s>
<s> several days later felix came with his wife drusilla  who was jewish  he sent for paul and listened to him as he spoke about faith in christ jesus </s>
<s> as paul talked about righteousness  selfcontrol and the judgment to come  felix was afraid and said   thats enough for now  you may leave  when i find it convenient  i will send for you  </s>
<s> at the same time he was hoping that paul would offer him a bribe  so he sent for him frequently and talked with him </s>
<s> when two years had passed  felix was succeeded by porcius festus  but because felix wanted to grant a favour to the jews  he left paul in prison </s>
<s> three days after arriving in the province  festus went up from caesarea to jerusalem </s>
<s> where the chief priests and the jewish leaders appeared before him and presented the charges against paul </s>
<s> they requested festus  as a favour to them  to have paul transferred to jerusalem  for they were preparing an ambush to kill him along the way </s>
<s> festus answered   paul is being held at caesarea  and i myself am going there soon </s>
<s> let some of your leaders come with me  and if the man has done anything wrong  they can press charges against him there  </s>
<s> after spending eight or ten days with them  festus went down to caesarea  the next day he convened the court and ordered that paul be brought before him </s>
<s> when paul came in  the jews who had come down from jerusalem stood round him  they brought many serious charges against him  but they could not prove them </s>
<s> then paul made his defence   i have done nothing wrong against the jewish law or against the temple or against caesar  </s>
<s> festus  wishing to do the jews a favour  said to paul   are you willing to go up to jerusalem and stand trial before me there on these charges  </s>
<s> paul answered   i am now standing before caesars court  where i ought to be tried  i have not done any wrong to the jews  as you yourself know very well </s>
<s> if  however  i am guilty of doing anything deserving death  i do not refuse to die  but if the charges brought against me by these jews are not true  no one has the right to hand me over to them  i appeal to caesar  </s>
<s> after festus had conferred with his council  he declared   you have appealed to caesar  to caesar you will go  </s>
<s> a few days later king agrippa and bernice arrived at caesarea to pay their respects to festus </s>
<s> since they were spending many days there  festus discussed pauls case with the king  he said   there is a man here whom felix left as a prisoner </s>
<s> when i went to jerusalem  the chief priests and the elders of the jews brought charges against him and asked that he be condemned </s>
<s>  i told them that it is not the roman custom to hand over anyone before they have faced their accusers and have had an opportunity to defend themselves against the charges </s>
<s> when they came here with me  i did not delay the case  but convened the court the next day and ordered the man to be brought in </s>
<s> when his accusers got up to speak  they did not charge him with any of the crimes i had expected </s>
<s> instead  they had some points of dispute with him about their own religion and about a dead man named jesus whom paul claimed was alive </s>
<s> i was at a loss how to investigate such matters  so i asked if he would be willing to go to jerusalem and stand trial there on these charges </s>
<s> but when paul made his appeal to be held over for the emperors decision  i ordered him to be held until i could send him to caesar  </s>
<s> then agrippa said to festus   i would like to hear this man myself   he replied   tomorrow you will hear him  </s>
<s> the next day agrippa and bernice came with great pomp and entered the audience room with the highranking military officers and the prominent men of the city  at the command of festus  paul was brought in </s>
<s> festus said   king agrippa  and all who are present with us  you see this man  the whole jewish community has petitioned me about him in jerusalem and here in caesarea  shouting that he ought not to live any longer </s>
<s> i found he had done nothing deserving of death  but because he made his appeal to the emperor i decided to send him to rome </s>
<s> but i have nothing definite to write to his majesty about him  therefore i have brought him before all of you  and especially before you  king agrippa  so that as a result of this investigation i may have something to write </s>
<s> for i think it is unreasonable to send a prisoner on to rome without specifying the charges against him  </s>
<s> then agrippa said to paul   you have permission to speak for yourself   so paul motioned with his hand and began his defence </s>
<s>  king agrippa  i consider myself fortunate to stand before you today as i make my defence against all the accusations of the jews </s>
<s> and especially so because you are well acquainted with all the jewish customs and controversies  therefore  i beg you to listen to me patiently </s>
<s>  the jewish people all know the way i have lived ever since i was a child  from the beginning of my life in my own country  and also in jerusalem </s>
<s> they have known me for a long time and can testify  if they are willing  that i conformed to the strictest sect of our religion  living as a pharisee </s>
<s> and now it is because of my hope in what god has promised our ancestors that i am on trial today </s>
<s> this is the promise our twelve tribes are hoping to see fulfilled as they earnestly serve god day and night  king agrippa  it is because of this hope that these jews are accusing me </s>
<s> why should any of you consider it incredible that god raises the dead </s>
<s>  i too was convinced that i ought to do all that was possible to oppose the name of jesus of nazareth </s>
<s> and that is just what i did in jerusalem  on the authority of the chief priests i put many of the lords people in prison  and when they were put to death  i cast my vote against them </s>
<s> many a time i went from one synagogue to another to have them punished  and i tried to force them to blaspheme  i was so obsessed with persecuting them that i even hunted them down in foreign cities </s>
<s>  on one of these journeys i was going to damascus with the authority and commission of the chief priests </s>
<s> about noon  king agrippa  as i was on the road  i saw a light from heaven  brighter than the sun  blazing around me and my companions </s>
<s> we all fell to the ground  and i heard a voice saying to me in aramaic   saul  saul  why do you persecute me  it is hard for you to kick against the goads  </s>
<s>  then i asked   who are you  lord     i am jesus  whom you are persecuting   the lord replied </s>
<s>  now get up and stand on your feet  i have appeared to you to appoint you as a servant and as a witness of what you have seen and will see of me </s>
<s> i will rescue you from your own people and from the gentiles  i am sending you to them</s>
<s> to open their eyes and turn them from darkness to light  and from the power of satan to god  so that they may receive forgiveness of sins and a place among those who are sanctified by faith in me  </s>
<s>  so then  king agrippa  i was not disobedient to the vision from heaven </s>
<s> first to those in damascus  then to those in jerusalem and in all judea  and then to the gentiles  i preached that they should repent and turn to god and demonstrate their repentance by their deeds </s>
<s> that is why some jews seized me in the temple courts and tried to kill me </s>
<s> but god has helped me to this very day  so i stand here and testify to small and great alike  i am saying nothing beyond what the prophets and moses said would happen </s>
<s> that the messiah would suffer and  as the first to rise from the dead  would bring the message of light to his own people and to the gentiles  </s>
<s> at this point festus interrupted pauls defence   you are out of your mind  paul   he shouted   your great learning is driving you insane  </s>
<s>  i am not insane  most excellent festus   paul replied   what i am saying is true and reasonable </s>
<s> the king is familiar with these things  and i can speak freely to him  i am convinced that none of this has escaped his notice  because it was not done in a corner </s>
<s> king agrippa  do you believe the prophets  i know you do  </s>
<s> then agrippa said to paul   do you think that in such a short time you can persuade me to be a christian  </s>
<s> paul replied   short time or long  i pray to god that not only you but all who are listening to me today may become what i am  except for these chains  </s>
<s> the king rose  and with him the governor and bernice and those sitting with them </s>
<s> after they left the room  they began saying to one another   this man is not doing anything that deserves death or imprisonment  </s>
<s> agrippa said to festus   this man could have been set free if he had not appealed to caesar  </s>
<s> when it was decided that we would sail for italy  paul and some other prisoners were handed over to a centurion named julius  who belonged to the imperial regiment </s>
<s> we boarded a ship from adramyttium about to sail for ports along the coast of the province of asia  and we put out to sea  aristarchus  a macedonian from thessalonica  was with us </s>
<s> the next day we landed at sidon  and julius  in kindness to paul  allowed him to go to his friends so they might provide for his needs </s>
<s> from there we put out to sea again and passed to the lee of cyprus because the winds were against us </s>
<s> when we had sailed across the open sea off the coast of cilicia and pamphylia  we landed at myra in lycia </s>
<s> there the centurion found an alexandrian ship sailing for italy and put us on board </s>
<s> we made slow headway for many days and had difficulty arriving off cnidus  when the wind did not allow us to hold our course  we sailed to the lee of crete  opposite salmone </s>
<s> we moved along the coast with difficulty and came to a place called fair havens  near the town of lasea </s>
<s> much time had been lost  and sailing had already become dangerous because by now it was after the day of atonement  so paul warned them </s>
<s>  men  i can see that our voyage is going to be disastrous and bring great loss to ship and cargo  and to our own lives also  </s>
<s> but the centurion  instead of listening to what paul said  followed the advice of the pilot and of the owner of the ship </s>
<s> since the harbour was unsuitable to winter in  the majority decided that we should sail on  hoping to reach phoenix and winter there  this was a harbour in crete  facing both southwest and northwest </s>
<s> when a gentle south wind began to blow  they saw their opportunity  so they weighed anchor and sailed along the shore of crete </s>
<s> before very long  a wind of hurricane force  called the  northeaster  swept down from the island </s>
<s> the ship was caught by the storm and could not head into the wind  so we gave way to it and were driven along </s>
<s> as we passed to the lee of a small island called cauda  we were hardly able to make the lifeboat secure </s>
<s> so the men hoisted it aboard  then they passed ropes under the ship itself to hold it together  because they were afraid they would run aground on the sandbars of syrtis  they lowered the sea anchor and let the ship be driven along </s>
<s> we took such a violent battering from the storm that the next day they began to throw the cargo overboard </s>
<s> on the third day  they threw the ships tackle overboard with their own hands </s>
<s> when neither sun nor stars appeared for many days and the storm continued raging  we finally gave up all hope of being saved </s>
<s> after they had gone a long time without food  paul stood up before them and said   men  you should have taken my advice not to sail from crete  then you would have spared yourselves this damage and loss </s>
<s> but now i urge you to keep up your courage  because not one of you will be lost  only the ship will be destroyed </s>
<s> last night an angel of the god to whom i belong and whom i serve stood beside me</s>
<s> and said   do not be afraid  paul  you must stand trial before caesar  and god has graciously given you the lives of all who sail with you  </s>
<s> so keep up your courage  men  for i have faith in god that it will happen just as he told me </s>
<s> nevertheless  we must run aground on some island  </s>
<s> on the fourteenth night we were still being driven across the adriatic sea  when about midnight the sailors sensed they were approaching land </s>
<s> they took soundings and found that the water was forty metres deep  a short time later they took soundings again and found it was thirty metres deep </s>
<s> fearing that we would be dashed against the rocks  they dropped four anchors from the stern and prayed for daylight </s>
<s> in an attempt to escape from the ship  the sailors let the lifeboat down into the sea  pretending they were going to lower some anchors from the bow </s>
<s> then paul said to the centurion and the soldiers   unless these men stay with the ship  you cannot be saved  </s>
<s> so the soldiers cut the ropes that held the lifeboat and let it drift away </s>
<s> just before dawn paul urged them all to eat   for the last fourteen days   he said   you have been in constant suspense and have gone without food  you havent eaten anything </s>
<s> now i urge you to take some food  you need it to survive  not one of you will lose a single hair from his head  </s>
<s> after he said this  he took some bread and gave thanks to god in front of them all  then he broke it and began to eat </s>
<s> they were all encouraged and ate some food themselves </s>
<s> altogether there were 276 of us on board </s>
<s> when they had eaten as much as they wanted  they lightened the ship by throwing the grain into the sea </s>
<s> when daylight came  they did not recognise the land  but they saw a bay with a sandy beach  where they decided to run the ship aground if they could </s>
<s> cutting loose the anchors  they left them in the sea and at the same time untied the ropes that held the rudders  then they hoisted the foresail to the wind and made for the beach </s>
<s> but the ship struck a sandbar and ran aground  the bow stuck fast and would not move  and the stern was broken to pieces by the pounding of the surf </s>
<s> the soldiers planned to kill the prisoners to prevent any of them from swimming away and escaping </s>
<s> but the centurion wanted to spare pauls life and kept them from carrying out their plan  he ordered those who could swim to jump overboard first and get to land </s>
<s> the rest were to get there on planks or on other pieces of the ship  in this way everyone reached land safely </s>
<s> once safely on shore  we found out that the island was called malta </s>
<s> the islanders showed us unusual kindness  they built a fire and welcomed us all because it was raining and cold </s>
<s> paul gathered a pile of brushwood and  as he put it on the fire  a viper  driven out by the heat  fastened itself on his hand </s>
<s> when the islanders saw the snake hanging from his hand  they said to each other   this man must be a murderer  for though he escaped from the sea  the goddess justice has not allowed him to live  </s>
<s> but paul shook the snake off into the fire and suffered no ill effects </s>
<s> the people expected him to swell up or suddenly fall dead  but after waiting a long time and seeing nothing unusual happen to him  they changed their minds and said he was a god </s>
<s> there was an estate near by that belonged to publius  the chief official of the island  he welcomed us to his home and showed us generous hospitality for three days </s>
<s> his father was ill in bed  suffering from fever and dysentery  paul went in to see him and  after prayer  placed his hands on him and healed him </s>
<s> when this had happened  the rest of those on the island who were ill came and were cured </s>
<s> they honoured us in many ways  and when we were ready to sail  they furnished us with the supplies we needed </s>
<s> after three months we put out to sea in a ship that had wintered in the island  it was an alexandrian ship with the figurehead of the twin gods castor and pollux </s>
<s> we put in at syracuse and stayed there three days </s>
<s> from there we set sail and arrived at rhegium  the next day the south wind came up  and on the following day we reached puteoli </s>
<s> there we found some brothers and sisters who invited us to spend a week with them  and so we came to rome </s>
<s> the brothers and sisters there had heard that we were coming  and they travelled as far as the forum of appius and the three taverns to meet us  at the sight of these people paul thanked god and was encouraged </s>
<s> when we got to rome  paul was allowed to live by himself  with a soldier to guard him </s>
<s> three days later he called together the local jewish leaders  when they had assembled  paul said to them   my brothers  although i have done nothing against our people or against the customs of our ancestors  i was arrested in jerusalem and handed over to the romans </s>
<s> they examined me and wanted to release me  because i was not guilty of any crime deserving death </s>
<s> the jews objected  so i was compelled to make an appeal to caesar  i certainly did not intend to bring any charge against my own people </s>
<s> for this reason i have asked to see you and talk with you  it is because of the hope of israel that i am bound with this chain  </s>
<s> they replied   we have not received any letters from judea concerning you  and none of our people who have come from there has reported or said anything bad about you </s>
<s> but we want to hear what your views are  for we know that people everywhere are talking against this sect  </s>
<s> they arranged to meet paul on a certain day  and came in even larger numbers to the place where he was staying  he witnessed to them from morning till evening  explaining about the kingdom of god  and from the law of moses and from the prophets he tried to persuade them about jesus </s>
<s> some were convinced by what he said  but others would not believe </s>
<s> they disagreed among themselves and began to leave after paul had made this final statement   the holy spirit spoke the truth to your ancestors when he said through isaiah the prophet </s>
<s>   go to this people and say   you will be ever hearing but never understanding  you will be ever seeing but never perceiving  </s>
<s> for this peoples heart has become calloused  they hardly hear with their ears  and they have closed their eyes  otherwise they might see with their eyes  hear with their ears  understand with their hearts and turn  and i would heal them  </s>
<s>  therefore i want you to know that gods salvation has been sent to the gentiles  and they will listen   </s>
<s> </s>
<s> for two whole years paul stayed there in his own rented house and welcomed all who came to see him </s>
<s> he proclaimed the kingdom of god and taught about the lord jesus christ  with all boldness and without hindrance </s>
<s> paul  a servant of christ jesus  called to be an apostle and set apart for the gospel of god </s>
<s> the gospel he promised beforehand through his prophets in the holy scriptures</s>
<s> regarding his son  who as to his earthly life was a descendant of david </s>
<s> and who through the spirit of holiness was appointed the son of god in power by his resurrection from the dead  jesus christ our lord </s>
<s> through him we received grace and apostleship to call all the gentiles to the obedience that comes from faith for his names sake </s>
<s> and you also are among those gentiles who are called to belong to jesus christ </s>
<s> to all in rome who are loved by god and called to be his holy people  grace and peace to you from god our father and from the lord jesus christ </s>
<s> first  i thank my god through jesus christ for all of you  because your faith is being reported all over the world </s>
<s> god  whom i serve in my spirit in preaching the gospel of his son  is my witness how constantly i remember you</s>
<s> in my prayers at all times  and i pray that now at last by gods will the way may be opened for me to come to you </s>
<s> i long to see you so that i may impart to you some spiritual gift to make you strong </s>
<s> that is  that you and i may be mutually encouraged by each others faith </s>
<s> i do not want you to be unaware  brothers and sisters  that i planned many times to come to you  but have been prevented from doing so until now  in order that i might have a harvest among you  just as i have had among the other gentiles </s>
<s> i am a debtor both to greeks and nongreeks  both to the wise and the foolish </s>
<s> that is why i am so eager to preach the gospel also to you who are in rome </s>
<s> for i am not ashamed of the gospel  because it is the power of god that brings salvation to everyone who believes  first to the jew  then to the gentile </s>
<s> for in the gospel the righteousness of god is revealed  a righteousness that is by faith from first to last  just as it is written   the righteous will live by faith  </s>
<s> the wrath of god is being revealed from heaven against all the godlessness and wickedness of people  who suppress the truth by their wickedness </s>
<s> since what may be known about god is plain to them  because god has made it plain to them </s>
<s> for since the creation of the world gods invisible qualities  his eternal power and divine nature  have been clearly seen  being understood from what has been made  so that people are without excuse </s>
<s> for although they knew god  they neither glorified him as god nor gave thanks to him  but their thinking became futile and their foolish hearts were darkened </s>
<s> although they claimed to be wise  they became fools</s>
<s> and exchanged the glory of the immortal god for images made to look like a mortal human being and birds and animals and reptiles </s>
<s> therefore god gave them over in the sinful desires of their hearts to sexual impurity for the degrading of their bodies with one another </s>
<s> they exchanged the truth about god for a lie  and worshipped and served created things rather than the creator  who is for ever praised  amen </s>
<s> because of this  god gave them over to shameful lusts  even their women exchanged natural sexual relations for unnatural ones </s>
<s> in the same way the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with lust for one another  men committed shameful acts with other men  and received in themselves the due penalty for their error </s>
<s> furthermore  just as they did not think it worth while to retain the knowledge of god  so god gave them over to a depraved mind  so that they do what ought not to be done </s>
<s> they have become filled with every kind of wickedness  evil  greed and depravity  they are full of envy  murder  strife  deceit and malice  they are gossips </s>
<s> slanderers  godhaters  insolent  arrogant and boastful  they invent ways of doing evil  they disobey their parents </s>
<s> they have no understanding  no fidelity  no love  no mercy </s>
<s> although they know gods righteous decree that those who do such things deserve death  they not only continue to do these very things but also approve of those who practise them </s>
<s> you  therefore  have no excuse  you who pass judgment on someone else  for at whatever point you judge another  you are condemning yourself  because you who pass judgment do the same things </s>
<s> now we know that gods judgment against those who do such things is based on truth </s>
<s> so when you  a mere human being  pass judgment on them and yet do the same things  do you think you will escape gods judgment </s>
<s> or do you show contempt for the riches of his kindness  forbearance and patience  not realising that gods kindness is intended to lead you to repentance </s>
<s> but because of your stubbornness and your unrepentant heart  you are storing up wrath against yourself for the day of gods wrath  when his righteous judgment will be revealed </s>
<s> god  will repay each person according to what they have done  </s>
<s> to those who by persistence in doing good seek glory  honour and immortality  he will give eternal life </s>
<s> but for those who are selfseeking and who reject the truth and follow evil  there will be wrath and anger </s>
<s> there will be trouble and distress for every human being who does evil  first for the jew  then for the gentile </s>
<s> but glory  honour and peace for everyone who does good  first for the jew  then for the gentile </s>
<s> for god does not show favouritism </s>
<s> all who sin apart from the law will also perish apart from the law  and all who sin under the law will be judged by the law </s>
<s> for it is not those who hear the law who are righteous in gods sight  but it is those who obey the law who will be declared righteous </s>
<s>  indeed  when gentiles  who do not have the law  do by nature things required by the law  they are a law for themselves  even though they do not have the law </s>
<s> they show that the requirements of the law are written on their hearts  their consciences also bearing witness  and their thoughts sometimes accusing them and at other times even defending them  </s>
<s> this will take place on the day when god judges peoples secrets through jesus christ  as my gospel declares </s>
<s> now you  if you call yourself a jew  if you rely on the law and boast in god </s>
<s> if you know his will and approve of what is superior because you are instructed by the law </s>
<s> if you are convinced that you are a guide for the blind  a light for those who are in the dark </s>
<s> an instructor of the foolish  a teacher of little children  because you have in the law the embodiment of knowledge and truth </s>
<s> you  then  who teach others  do you not teach yourself  you who preach against stealing  do you steal </s>
<s> you who say that people should not commit adultery  do you commit adultery  you who abhor idols  do you rob temples </s>
<s> you who boast in the law  do you dishonour god by breaking the law </s>
<s> as it is written   gods name is blasphemed among the gentiles because of you  </s>
<s> circumcision has value if you observe the law  but if you break the law  you have become as though you had not been circumcised </s>
<s> so then  if those who are not circumcised keep the laws requirements  will they not be regarded as though they were circumcised </s>
<s> the one who is not circumcised physically and yet obeys the law will condemn you who  even though you have the written code and circumcision  are a lawbreaker </s>
<s> a person is not a jew who is one only outwardly  nor is circumcision merely outward and physical </s>
<s> no  a person is a jew who is one inwardly  and circumcision is circumcision of the heart  by the spirit  not by the written code  such a persons praise is not from other people  but from god </s>
<s> what advantage  then  is there in being a jew  or what value is there in circumcision </s>
<s> much in every way  first of all  the jews have been entrusted with the very words of god </s>
<s> what if some were unfaithful  will their unfaithfulness nullify gods faithfulness </s>
<s> not at all  let god be true  and every human being a liar  as it is written   so that you may be proved right when you speak and prevail when you judge  </s>
<s> but if our unrighteousness brings out gods righteousness more clearly  what shall we say  that god is unjust in bringing his wrath on us   i am using a human argument  </s>
<s> certainly not  if that were so  how could god judge the world </s>
<s> someone might argue   if my falsehood enhances gods truthfulness and so increases his glory  why am i still condemned as a sinner  </s>
<s> why not say  as some slanderously claim that we say   let us do evil that good may result  their condemnation is just </s>
<s> what shall we conclude then  do we have any advantage  not at all  for we have already made the charge that jews and gentiles alike are all under the power of sin </s>
<s> as it is written   there is no one righteous  not even one </s>
<s> there is no one who understands  there is no one who seeks god </s>
<s> all have turned away  they have together become worthless  there is no one who does good  not even one  </s>
<s>  their throats are open graves  their tongues practise deceit    the poison of vipers is on their lips  </s>
<s>  their mouths are full of cursing and bitterness  </s>
<s>  their feet are swift to shed blood </s>
<s> ruin and misery mark their ways </s>
<s> and the way of peace they do not know  </s>
<s>  there is no fear of god before their eyes  </s>
<s> now we know that whatever the law says  it says to those who are under the law  so that every mouth may be silenced and the whole world held accountable to god </s>
<s> therefore no one will be declared righteous in gods sight by the works of the law  rather  through the law we become conscious of our sin </s>
<s> but now apart from the law the righteousness of god has been made known  to which the law and the prophets testify </s>
<s> this righteousness is given through faith in jesus christ to all who believe  there is no difference between jew and gentile </s>
<s> for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of god </s>
<s> and all are justified freely by his grace through the redemption that came by christ jesus </s>
<s> god presented christ as a sacrifice of atonement  through the shedding of his blood  to be received by faith  he did this to demonstrate his righteousness  because in his forbearance he had left the sins committed beforehand unpunished</s>
<s>  he did it to demonstrate his righteousness at the present time  so as to be just and the one who justifies those who have faith in jesus </s>
<s> where  then  is boasting  it is excluded  because of what law  the law that requires works  no  because of the  law that requires faith </s>
<s> for we maintain that a person is justified by faith apart from the works of the law </s>
<s> or is god the god of jews only  is he not the god of gentiles too  yes  of gentiles too </s>
<s> since there is only one god  who will justify the circumcised by faith and the uncircumcised through that same faith </s>
<s> do we  then  nullify the law by this faith  not at all  rather  we uphold the law </s>
<s> what then shall we say that abraham  our forefather according to the flesh  discovered in this matter </s>
<s> if  in fact  abraham was justified by works  he had something to boast about  but not before god </s>
<s> what does scripture say   abraham believed god  and it was credited to him as righteousness  </s>
<s> now to the one who works  wages are not credited as a gift but as an obligation </s>
<s> however  to the one who does not work but trusts god who justifies the ungodly  their faith is credited as righteousness </s>
<s> david says the same thing when he speaks of the blessedness of the one to whom god credits righteousness apart from works </s>
<s>  blessed are those whose transgressions are forgiven  whose sins are covered </s>
<s> blessed is the one whose sin the lord will never count against them  </s>
<s> is this blessedness only for the circumcised  or also for the uncircumcised  we have been saying that abrahams faith was credited to him as righteousness </s>
<s> under what circumstances was it credited  was it after he was circumcised  or before  it was not after  but before </s>
<s> and he received circumcision as a sign  a seal of the righteousness that he had by faith while he was still uncircumcised  so then  he is the father of all who believe but have not been circumcised  in order that righteousness might be credited to them </s>
<s> and he is then also the father of the circumcised who not only are circumcised but who also follow in the footsteps of the faith that our father abraham had before he was circumcised </s>
<s> it was not through the law that abraham and his offspring received the promise that he would be heir of the world  but through the righteousness that comes by faith </s>
<s> for if those who depend on the law are heirs  faith means nothing and the promise is worthless </s>
<s> because the law brings wrath  and where there is no law there is no transgression </s>
<s> therefore  the promise comes by faith  so that it may be by grace and may be guaranteed to all abrahams offspring  not only to those who are of the law but also to those who have the faith of abraham  he is the father of us all </s>
<s> as it is written   i have made you a father of many nations   he is our father in the sight of god  in whom he believed  the god who gives life to the dead and calls into being things that were not </s>
<s> against all hope  abraham in hope believed and so became the father of many nations  just as it had been said to him   so shall your offspring be  </s>
<s> without weakening in his faith  he faced the fact that his body was as good as dead  since he was about a hundred years old  and that sarahs womb was also dead </s>
<s> yet he did not waver through unbelief regarding the promise of god  but was strengthened in his faith and gave glory to god </s>
<s> being fully persuaded that god had power to do what he had promised </s>
<s> this is why  it was credited to him as righteousness  </s>
<s> the words  it was credited to him were written not for him alone </s>
<s> but also for us  to whom god will credit righteousness  for us who believe in him who raised jesus our lord from the dead </s>
<s> he was delivered over to death for our sins and was raised to life for our justification </s>
<s> therefore  since we have been justified through faith  we have peace with god through our lord jesus christ </s>
<s> through whom we have gained access by faith into this grace in which we now stand  and we boast in the hope of the glory of god </s>
<s> not only so  but we also glory in our sufferings  because we know that suffering produces perseverance </s>
<s> perseverance  character  and character  hope </s>
<s> and hope does not put us to shame  because gods love has been poured out into our hearts through the holy spirit  who has been given to us </s>
<s> you see  at just the right time  when we were still powerless  christ died for the ungodly </s>
<s> very rarely will anyone die for a righteous person  though for a good person someone might possibly dare to die </s>
<s> but god demonstrates his own love for us in this  while we were still sinners  christ died for us </s>
<s> since we have now been justified by his blood  how much more shall we be saved from gods wrath through him </s>
<s> for if  while we were gods enemies  we were reconciled to him through the death of his son  how much more  having been reconciled  shall we be saved through his life </s>
<s> not only is this so  but we also boast in god through our lord jesus christ  through whom we have now received reconciliation </s>
<s> therefore  just as sin entered the world through one man  and death through sin  and in this way death came to all people  because all sinned </s>
<s> to be sure  sin was in the world before the law was given  but sin is not charged against anyones account where there is no law </s>
<s> nevertheless  death reigned from the time of adam to the time of moses  even over those who did not sin by breaking a command  as did adam  who is a pattern of the one to come </s>
<s> but the gift is not like the trespass  for if the many died by the trespass of the one man  how much more did gods grace and the gift that came by the grace of the one man  jesus christ  overflow to the many </s>
<s> nor can the gift of god be compared with the result of one mans sin  the judgment followed one sin and brought condemnation  but the gift followed many trespasses and brought justification </s>
<s> for if  by the trespass of the one man  death reigned through that one man  how much more will those who receive gods abundant provision of grace and of the gift of righteousness reign in life through the one man  jesus christ </s>
<s> consequently  just as one trespass resulted in condemnation for all people  so also one righteous act resulted in justification and life for all people </s>
<s> for just as through the disobedience of the one man the many were made sinners  so also through the obedience of the one man the many will be made righteous </s>
<s> the law was brought in so that the trespass might increase  but where sin increased  grace increased all the more </s>
<s> so that  just as sin reigned in death  so also grace might reign through righteousness to bring eternal life through jesus christ our lord </s>
<s> what shall we say  then  shall we go on sinning  so that grace may increase </s>
<s> by no means  we are those who have died to sin  how can we live in it any longer </s>
<s> or dont you know that all of us who were baptised into christ jesus were baptised into his death </s>
<s> we were therefore buried with him through baptism into death in order that  just as christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the father  we too may live a new life </s>
<s> for if we have been united with him in a death like his  we will certainly also be united with him in a resurrection like his </s>
<s> for we know that our old self was crucified with him so that the body ruled by sin might be done away with  that we should no longer be slaves to sin </s>
<s> because anyone who has died has been set free from sin </s>
<s> now if we died with christ  we believe that we will also live with him </s>
<s> for we know that since christ was raised from the dead  he cannot die again  death no longer has mastery over him </s>
<s> the death he died  he died to sin once for all  but the life he lives  he lives to god </s>
<s> in the same way  count yourselves dead to sin but alive to god in christ jesus </s>
<s> therefore do not let sin reign in your mortal body so that you obey its evil desires </s>
<s> do not offer any part of yourself to sin as an instrument of wickedness  but rather offer yourselves to god as those who have been brought from death to life  and offer every part of yourself to him as an instrument of righteousness </s>
<s> for sin shall no longer be your master  because you are not under the law  but under grace </s>
<s> what then  shall we sin because we are not under the law but under grace  by no means </s>
<s> dont you know that when you offer yourselves to someone as obedient slaves  you are slaves of the one you obey  whether you are slaves to sin  which leads to death  or to obedience  which leads to righteousness </s>
<s> but thanks be to god that  though you used to be slaves to sin  you have come to obey from your heart the pattern of teaching that has now claimed your allegiance </s>
<s> you have been set free from sin and have become slaves to righteousness </s>
<s> i am using an example from everyday life because of your human limitations  just as you used to offer yourselves as slaves to impurity and to everincreasing wickedness  so now offer yourselves as slaves to righteousness leading to holiness </s>
<s> when you were slaves to sin  you were free from the control of righteousness </s>
<s> what benefit did you reap at that time from the things you are now ashamed of  those things result in death </s>
<s> but now that you have been set free from sin and have become slaves of god  the benefit you reap leads to holiness  and the result is eternal life </s>
<s> for the wages of sin is death  but the gift of god is eternal life in christ jesus our lord </s>
<s> do you not know  brothers and sisters  for i am speaking to those who know the law  that the law has authority over someone only as long as that person lives </s>
<s> for example  by law a married woman is bound to her husband as long as he is alive  but if her husband dies  she is released from the law that binds her to him </s>
<s> so then  if she has sexual relations with another man while her husband is still alive  she is called an adulteress  but if her husband dies  she is released from that law and is not an adulteress if she marries another man </s>
<s> so  my brothers and sisters  you also died to the law through the body of christ  that you might belong to another  to him who was raised from the dead  in order that we might bear fruit for god </s>
<s> for when we were in the realm of the flesh  the sinful passions aroused by the law were at work in us  so that we bore fruit for death </s>
<s> but now  by dying to what once bound us  we have been released from the law so that we serve in the new way of the spirit  and not in the old way of the written code </s>
<s> what shall we say  then  is the law sinful  certainly not  nevertheless  i would not have known what sin was had it not been for the law  for i would not have known what coveting really was if the law had not said   you shall not covet  </s>
<s> but sin  seizing the opportunity afforded by the commandment  produced in me every kind of coveting  for apart from the law  sin was dead </s>
<s> once i was alive apart from the law  but when the commandment came  sin sprang to life and i died </s>
<s> i found that the very commandment that was intended to bring life actually brought death </s>
<s> for sin  seizing the opportunity afforded by the commandment  deceived me  and through the commandment put me to death </s>
<s> so then  the law is holy  and the commandment is holy  righteous and good </s>
<s> did that which is good  then  become death to me  by no means  nevertheless  in order that sin might be recognised as sin  it used what is good to bring about my death  so that through the commandment sin might become utterly sinful </s>
<s> we know that the law is spiritual  but i am unspiritual  sold as a slave to sin </s>
<s> i do not understand what i do  for what i want to do i do not do  but what i hate i do </s>
<s> and if i do what i do not want to do  i agree that the law is good </s>
<s> as it is  it is no longer i myself who do it  but it is sin living in me </s>
<s> for i know that good itself does not dwell in me  that is  in my sinful nature  for i have the desire to do what is good  but i cannot carry it out </s>
<s> for i do not do the good i want to do  but the evil i do not want to do  this i keep on doing </s>
<s> now if i do what i do not want to do  it is no longer i who do it  but it is sin living in me that does it </s>
<s> so i find this law at work  although i want to do good  evil is right there with me </s>
<s> for in my inner being i delight in gods law </s>
<s> but i see another law at work in me  waging war against the law of my mind and making me a prisoner of the law of sin at work within me </s>
<s> what a wretched man i am  who will rescue me from this body that is subject to death </s>
<s> thanks be to god  who delivers me through jesus christ our lord  so then  i myself in my mind am a slave to gods law  but in my sinful nature a slave to the law of sin </s>
<s> therefore  there is now no condemnation for those who are in christ jesus </s>
<s> because through christ jesus the law of the spirit who gives life has set you free from the law of sin and death </s>
<s> for what the law was powerless to do because it was weakened by the flesh  god did by sending his own son in the likeness of sinful flesh to be a sin offering  and so he condemned sin in the flesh </s>
<s> in order that the righteous requirement of the law might be fully met in us  who do not live according to the flesh but according to the spirit </s>
<s> those who live according to the flesh have their minds set on what the flesh desires  but those who live in accordance with the spirit have their minds set on what the spirit desires </s>
<s> the mind governed by the flesh is death  but the mind governed by the spirit is life and peace </s>
<s> the mind governed by the flesh is hostile to god  it does not submit to gods law  nor can it do so </s>
<s> those who are in the realm of the flesh cannot please god </s>
<s> you  however  are not in the realm of the flesh but are in the realm of the spirit  if indeed the spirit of god lives in you  and if anyone does not have the spirit of christ  they do not belong to christ </s>
<s> but if christ is in you  then even though your body is subject to death because of sin  the spirit gives life because of righteousness </s>
<s> and if the spirit of him who raised jesus from the dead is living in you  he who raised christ from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies because of his spirit who lives in you </s>
<s> therefore  brothers and sisters  we have an obligation  but it is not to the flesh  to live according to it </s>
<s> for if you live according to the flesh  you will die  but if by the spirit you put to death the misdeeds of the body  you will live </s>
<s> for those who are led by the spirit of god are the children of god </s>
<s> the spirit you received does not make you slaves  so that you live in fear again  rather  the spirit you received brought about your adoption to sonship  and by him we cry   abba  father  </s>
<s> the spirit himself testifies with our spirit that we are gods children </s>
<s> now if we are children  then we are heirs  heirs of god and coheirs with christ  if indeed we share in his sufferings in order that we may also share in his glory </s>
<s> i consider that our present sufferings are not worth comparing with the glory that will be revealed in us </s>
<s> for the creation waits in eager expectation for the children of god to be revealed </s>
<s> for the creation was subjected to frustration  not by its own choice  but by the will of the one who subjected it  in hope</s>
<s> that the creation itself will be liberated from its bondage to decay and brought into the freedom and glory of the children of god </s>
<s> we know that the whole creation has been groaning as in the pains of childbirth right up to the present time </s>
<s> not only so  but we ourselves  who have the firstfruits of the spirit  groan inwardly as we wait eagerly for our adoption to sonship  the redemption of our bodies </s>
<s> for in this hope we were saved  but hope that is seen is no hope at all  who hopes for what they already have </s>
<s> but if we hope for what we do not yet have  we wait for it patiently </s>
<s> in the same way  the spirit helps us in our weakness  we do not know what we ought to pray for  but the spirit himself intercedes for us through wordless groans </s>
<s> and he who searches our hearts knows the mind of the spirit  because the spirit intercedes for gods people in accordance with the will of god </s>
<s> and we know that in all things god works for the good of those who love him  who have been called according to his purpose </s>
<s> for those god foreknew he also predestined to be conformed to the image of his son  that he might be the firstborn among many brothers and sisters </s>
<s> and those he predestined  he also called  those he called  he also justified  those he justified  he also glorified </s>
<s> what  then  shall we say in response to these things  if god is for us  who can be against us </s>
<s> he who did not spare his own son  but gave him up for us all  how will he not also  along with him  graciously give us all things </s>
<s> who will bring any charge against those whom god has chosen  it is god who justifies </s>
<s> who then is the one who condemns  no one  christ jesus who died  more than that  who was raised to life  is at the right hand of god and is also interceding for us </s>
<s> who shall separate us from the love of christ  shall trouble or hardship or persecution or famine or nakedness or danger or sword </s>
<s> as it is written   for your sake we face death all day long  we are considered as sheep to be slaughtered  </s>
<s> i speak the truth in christ  i am not lying  my conscience confirms it through the holy spirit </s>
<s> i have great sorrow and unceasing anguish in my heart </s>
<s> for i could wish that i myself were cursed and cut off from christ for the sake of my people  those of my own race </s>
<s> the people of israel  theirs is the adoption to sonship  theirs the divine glory  the covenants  the receiving of the law  the temple worship and the promises </s>
<s> theirs are the patriarchs  and from them is traced the human ancestry of the messiah  who is god over all  for ever praised  amen </s>
<s> it is not as though gods word had failed  for not all who are descended from israel are israel </s>
<s> nor because they are his descendants are they all abrahams children  on the contrary   it is through isaac that your offspring will be reckoned  </s>
<s> in other words  it is not the children by physical descent who are gods children  but it is the children of the promise who are regarded as abrahams offspring </s>
<s> for this was how the promise was stated   at the appointed time i will return  and sarah will have a son  </s>
<s> not only that  but rebekahs children were conceived at the same time by our father isaac </s>
<s> yet  before the twins were born or had done anything good or bad  in order that gods purpose in election might stand </s>
<s> not by works but by him who calls  she was told   the older will serve the younger  </s>
<s> just as it is written   jacob i loved  but esau i hated  </s>
<s> what then shall we say  is god unjust  not at all </s>
<s> for he says to moses   i will have mercy on whom i have mercy  and i will have compassion on whom i have compassion  </s>
<s> one of you will say to me   then why does god still blame us  for who is able to resist his will  </s>
<s> but who are you  a human being  to talk back to god   shall what is formed say to the one who formed it   why did you make me like this   </s>
<s> does not the potter have the right to make out of the same lump of clay some pottery for special purposes and some for common use </s>
<s> what if god  although choosing to show his wrath and make his power known  bore with great patience the objects of his wrath  prepared for destruction </s>
<s> what if he did this to make the riches of his glory known to the objects of his mercy  whom he prepared in advance for glory </s>
<s> even us  whom he also called  not only from the jews but also from the gentiles </s>
<s> as he says in hosea   i will call them  my people  who are not my people  and i will call her  my loved one  who is not my loved one    in the very place where it was said to them   you are not my people   there they will be called  children of the living god     though the number of the israelites be like the sand by the sea  only the remnant will be saved </s>
<s> for the lord will carry out his sentence on earth with speed and finality    unless the lord almighty had left us descendants  we would have become like sodom  we would have been like gomorrah  </s>
<s> what then shall we say  that the gentiles  who did not pursue righteousness  have obtained it  a righteousness that is by faith </s>
<s> but the people of israel  who pursued the law as the way of righteousness  have not attained their goal </s>
<s> why not  because they pursued it not by faith but as if it were by works  they stumbled over the  stumbling stone  </s>
<s> as it is written   see  i lay in zion a stone that causes people to stumble and a rock that makes them fall  and the one who believes in him will never be put to shame  </s>
<s> brothers and sisters  my hearts desire and prayer to god for the israelites is that they may be saved </s>
<s> for i can testify about them that they are zealous for god  but their zeal is not based on knowledge </s>
<s> since they did not know the righteousness of god and sought to establish their own  they did not submit to gods righteousness </s>
<s> christ is the culmination of the law so that there may be righteousness for everyone who believes </s>
<s> moses writes this about the righteousness that is by the law   the person who does these things will live by them  </s>
<s> but the righteousness that is by faith says   do not say in your heart   who will ascend into heaven     that is  to bring christ down </s>
<s>  or  who will descend into the deep     that is  to bring christ up from the dead  </s>
<s> but what does it say   the word is near you  it is in your mouth and in your heart   that is  the message concerning faith that we proclaim </s>
<s> if you declare with your mouth   jesus is lord   and believe in your heart that god raised him from the dead  you will be saved </s>
<s> for it is with your heart that you believe and are justified  and it is with your mouth that you profess your faith and are saved </s>
<s> as scripture says   anyone who believes in him will never be put to shame  </s>
<s> for there is no difference between jew and gentile  the same lord is lord of all and richly blesses all who call on him </s>
<s> for   everyone who calls on the name of the lord will be saved  </s>
<s> how  then  can they call on the one they have not believed in  and how can they believe in the one of whom they have not heard  and how can they hear without someone preaching to them </s>
<s> and how can anyone preach unless they are sent  as it is written   how beautiful are the feet of those who bring good news  </s>
<s> but not all the israelites accepted the good news  for isaiah says   lord  who has believed our message  </s>
<s> consequently  faith comes from hearing the message  and the message is heard through the word about christ </s>
<s> but i ask  did they not hear  of course they did   their voice has gone out into all the earth  their words to the ends of the world    i will make you envious by those who are not a nation  i will make you angry by a nation that has no understanding    i was found by those who did not seek me  i revealed myself to those who did not ask for me    all day long i have held out my hands to a disobedient and obstinate people  </s>
<s> i ask then  did god reject his people  by no means  i am an israelite myself  a descendant of abraham  from the tribe of benjamin </s>
<s> god did not reject his people  whom he foreknew  dont you know what scripture says in the passage about elijah  how he appealed to god against israel </s>
<s>  lord  they have killed your prophets and torn down your altars  i am the only one left  and they are trying to kill me </s>
<s> and what was gods answer to him   i have reserved for myself seven thousand who have not bowed the knee to baal  </s>
<s> so too  at the present time there is a remnant chosen by grace </s>
<s> and if by grace  then it cannot be based on works  if it were  grace would no longer be grace </s>
<s> what then  what the people of israel sought so earnestly they did not obtain  the elect among them did  but the others were hardened </s>
<s> as it is written   god gave them a spirit of stupor  eyes that could not see and ears that could not hear  to this very day    may their table become a snare and a trap  a stumblingblock and a retribution for them </s>
<s> may their eyes be darkened so they cannot see  and their backs be bent for ever  </s>
<s> again i ask  did they stumble so as to fall beyond recovery  not at all  rather  because of their transgression  salvation has come to the gentiles to make israel envious </s>
<s> but if their transgression means riches for the world  and their loss means riches for the gentiles  how much greater riches will their full inclusion bring </s>
<s> i am talking to you gentiles  inasmuch as i am the apostle to the gentiles  i take pride in my ministry</s>
<s> in the hope that i may somehow arouse my own people to envy and save some of them </s>
<s> for if their rejection brought reconciliation to the world  what will their acceptance be but life from the dead </s>
<s> if the part of the dough offered as firstfruits is holy  then the whole batch is holy  if the root is holy  so are the branches </s>
<s> if some of the branches have been broken off  and you  though a wild olive shoot  have been grafted in among the others and now share in the nourishing sap from the olive root </s>
<s> do not consider yourself to be superior to those other branches  if you do  consider this  you do not support the root  but the root supports you </s>
<s> you will say then   branches were broken off so that i could be grafted in  </s>
<s> granted  but they were broken off because of unbelief  and you stand by faith  do not be arrogant  but tremble </s>
<s> for if god did not spare the natural branches  he will not spare you either </s>
<s> consider therefore the kindness and sternness of god  sternness to those who fell  but kindness to you  provided that you continue in his kindness  otherwise  you also will be cut off </s>
<s> and if they do not persist in unbelief  they will be grafted in  for god is able to graft them in again </s>
<s> after all  if you were cut out of an olive tree that is wild by nature  and contrary to nature were grafted into a cultivated olive tree  how much more readily will these  the natural branches  be grafted into their own olive tree </s>
<s> i do not want you to be ignorant of this mystery  brothers and sisters  so that you may not be conceited  israel has experienced a hardening in part until the full number of the gentiles has come in </s>
<s> and in this way all israel will be saved  as it is written   the deliverer will come from zion  he will turn godlessness away from jacob </s>
<s> and this is my covenant with them when i take away their sins  </s>
<s> as far as the gospel is concerned  they are enemies for your sake  but as far as election is concerned  they are loved on account of the patriarchs </s>
<s> for gods gifts and his call are irrevocable </s>
<s> just as you who were at one time disobedient to god have now received mercy as a result of their disobedience </s>
<s> so they too have now become disobedient in order that they too may now receive mercy as a result of gods mercy to you </s>
<s> for god has bound everyone over to disobedience so that he may have mercy on them all </s>
<s> oh  the depth of the riches of the wisdom and knowledge of god  how unsearchable his judgments  and his paths beyond tracing out </s>
<s>  who has known the mind of the lord  or who has been his counsellor  </s>
<s>  who has ever given to god  that god should repay them  </s>
<s> for from him and through him and for him are all things  to him be the glory for ever  amen </s>
<s> therefore  i urge you  brothers and sisters  in view of gods mercy  to offer your bodies as a living sacrifice  holy and pleasing to god  this is your true and proper worship </s>
<s> do not conform to the pattern of this world  but be transformed by the renewing of your mind  then you will be able to test and approve what gods will is  his good  pleasing and perfect will </s>
<s> for by the grace given me i say to every one of you  do not think of yourself more highly than you ought  but rather think of yourself with sober judgment  in accordance with the faith god has distributed to each of you </s>
<s> for just as each of us has one body with many members  and these members do not all have the same function </s>
<s> so in christ we  though many  form one body  and each member belongs to all the others </s>
<s> we have different gifts  according to the grace given to each of us  if your gift is prophesying  then prophesy in accordance with your faith </s>
<s> if it is serving  then serve  if it is teaching  then teach </s>
<s> if it is to encourage  then give encouragement  if it is giving  then give generously  if it is to lead  do it diligently  if it is to show mercy  do it cheerfully </s>
<s> love must be sincere  hate what is evil  cling to what is good </s>
<s> be devoted to one another in love  honour one another above yourselves </s>
<s> never be lacking in zeal  but keep your spiritual fervour  serving the lord </s>
<s> be joyful in hope  patient in affliction  faithful in prayer </s>
<s> share with the lords people who are in need  practise hospitality </s>
<s> bless those who persecute you  bless and do not curse </s>
<s> rejoice with those who rejoice  mourn with those who mourn </s>
<s> live in harmony with one another  do not be proud  but be willing to associate with people of low position  do not be conceited </s>
<s> do not repay anyone evil for evil  be careful to do what is right in the eyes of everyone </s>
<s> if it is possible  as far as it depends on you  live at peace with everyone </s>
<s> do not take revenge  my dear friends  but leave room for gods wrath  for it is written   it is mine to avenge  i will repay   says the lord </s>
<s> on the contrary   if your enemy is hungry  feed him  if he is thirsty  give him something to drink  in doing this  you will heap burning coals on his head  </s>
<s> let everyone be subject to the governing authorities  for there is no authority except that which god has established  the authorities that exist have been established by god </s>
<s> consequently  whoever rebels against the authority is rebelling against what god has instituted  and those who do so will bring judgment on themselves </s>
<s> for rulers hold no terror for those who do right  but for those who do wrong  do you want to be free from fear of the one in authority  then do what is right and you will be commended </s>
<s> for the one in authority is gods servant for your good  but if you do wrong  be afraid  for rulers do not bear the sword for no reason  they are gods servants  agents of wrath to bring punishment on the wrongdoer </s>
<s> therefore  it is necessary to submit to the authorities  not only because of possible punishment but also as a matter of conscience </s>
<s> this is also why you pay taxes  for the authorities are gods servants  who give their full time to governing </s>
<s> give to everyone what you owe them  if you owe taxes  pay taxes  if revenue  then revenue  if respect  then respect  if honour  then honour </s>
<s> let no debt remain outstanding  except the continuing debt to love one another  for whoever loves others has fulfilled the law </s>
<s> the commandments   you shall not commit adultery    you shall not murder    you shall not steal    you shall not covet   and whatever other command there may be  are summed up in this one command   love your neighbour as yourself  </s>
<s> love does no harm to a neighbour  therefore love is the fulfilment of the law </s>
<s> and do this  understanding the present time  the hour has already come for you to wake up from your slumber  because our salvation is nearer now than when we first believed </s>
<s> the night is nearly over  the day is almost here  so let us put aside the deeds of darkness and put on the armour of light </s>
<s> let us behave decently  as in the daytime  not in carousing and drunkenness  not in sexual immorality and debauchery  not in dissension and jealousy </s>
<s> rather  clothe yourselves with the lord jesus christ  and do not think about how to gratify the desires of the flesh </s>
<s> accept the one whose faith is weak  without quarrelling over disputable matters </s>
<s> one persons faith allows them to eat anything  but another  whose faith is weak  eats only vegetables </s>
<s> the one who eats everything must not treat with contempt the one who does not  and the one who does not eat everything must not judge the one who does  for god has accepted them </s>
<s> who are you to judge someone elses servant  to their own master  servants stand or fall  and they will stand  for the lord is able to make them stand </s>
<s> one person considers one day more sacred than another  another considers every day alike  each of them should be fully convinced in their own mind </s>
<s> whoever regards one day as special does so to the lord  whoever eats meat does so to the lord  for they give thanks to god  and whoever abstains does so to the lord and gives thanks to god </s>
<s> for none of us lives for ourselves alone  and none of us dies for ourselves alone </s>
<s> if we live  we live for the lord  and if we die  we die for the lord  so  whether we live or die  we belong to the lord </s>
<s> for this very reason  christ died and returned to life so that he might be the lord of both the dead and the living </s>
<s> you  then  why do you judge your brother or sister  or why do you treat them with contempt  for we will all stand before gods judgment seat </s>
<s> it is written    as surely as i live   says the lord   every knee will bow before me  every tongue will acknowledge god   </s>
<s> therefore let us stop passing judgment on one another  instead  make up your mind not to put any stumblingblock or obstacle in the way of a brother or sister </s>
<s> i am convinced  being fully persuaded in the lord jesus  that nothing is unclean in itself  but if anyone regards something as unclean  then for that person it is unclean </s>
<s> if your brother or sister is distressed because of what you eat  you are no longer acting in love  do not by your eating destroy someone for whom christ died </s>
<s> therefore do not let what you know is good be spoken of as evil </s>
<s> for the kingdom of god is not a matter of eating and drinking  but of righteousness  peace and joy in the holy spirit </s>
<s> because anyone who serves christ in this way is pleasing to god and receives human approval </s>
<s> let us therefore make every effort to do what leads to peace and to mutual edification </s>
<s> do not destroy the work of god for the sake of food  all food is clean  but it is wrong for a person to eat anything that causes someone else to stumble </s>
<s> it is better not to eat meat or drink wine or to do anything else that will cause your brother or sister to fall </s>
<s> so whatever you believe about these things keep between yourself and god  blessed is the one who does not condemn himself by what he approves </s>
<s> but whoever has doubts is condemned if they eat  because their eating is not from faith  and everything that does not come from faith is sin </s>
<s> we who are strong ought to bear with the failings of the weak and not to please ourselves </s>
<s> each of us should please our neighbours for their good  to build them up </s>
<s> for even christ did not please himself but  as it is written   the insults of those who insult you have fallen on me  </s>

<s> to the church of god in corinth  to those sanctified in christ jesus and called to be his holy people  together with all those everywhere who call on the name of our lord jesus christ  their lord and ours </s>
<s> grace and peace to you from god our father and the lord jesus christ </s>
<s> i always thank my god for you because of his grace given you in christ jesus </s>
<s> for in him you have been enriched in every way  with all kinds of speech and with all knowledge </s>
<s> god thus confirming our testimony about christ among you </s>
<s> therefore you do not lack any spiritual gift as you eagerly wait for our lord jesus christ to be revealed </s>
<s> he will also keep you firm to the end  so that you will be blameless on the day of our lord jesus christ </s>
<s> god is faithful  who has called you into fellowship with his son  jesus christ our lord </s>
<s> i appeal to you  brothers and sisters  in the name of our lord jesus christ  that all of you agree with one another in what you say and that there be no divisions among you  but that you be perfectly united in mind and thought </s>
<s> my brothers and sisters  some from chloes household have informed me that there are quarrels among you </s>
<s> what i mean is this  one of you says   i follow paul  another   i follow apollos  another   i follow cephas   still another   i follow christ  </s>
<s> is christ divided  was paul crucified for you  were you baptised in the name of paul </s>
<s> i thank god that i did not baptise any of you except crispus and gaius </s>
<s> so no one can say that you were baptised in my name </s>
<s>  yes  i also baptised the household of stephanas  beyond that  i dont remember if i baptised anyone else  </s>
<s> for christ did not send me to baptise  but to preach the gospel  not with wisdom and eloquence  lest the cross of christ be emptied of its power </s>
<s> for the message of the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing  but to us who are being saved it is the power of god </s>
<s> for it is written   i will destroy the wisdom of the wise  the intelligence of the intelligent i will frustrate  </s>
<s> where is the wise person  where is the teacher of the law  where is the philosopher of this age  has not god made foolish the wisdom of the world </s>
<s> for since in the wisdom of god the world through its wisdom did not know him  god was pleased through the foolishness of what was preached to save those who believe </s>
<s> jews demand signs and greeks look for wisdom </s>
<s> but we preach christ crucified  a stumblingblock to jews and foolishness to gentiles </s>
<s> but to those whom god has called  both jews and greeks  christ the power of god and the wisdom of god </s>
<s> for the foolishness of god is wiser than human wisdom  and the weakness of god is stronger than human strength </s>
<s> brothers and sisters  think of what you were when you were called  not many of you were wise by human standards  not many were influential  not many were of noble birth </s>
<s> but god chose the foolish things of the world to shame the wise  god chose the weak things of the world to shame the strong </s>
<s> god chose the lowly things of this world and the despised things  and the things that are not  to nullify the things that are </s>
<s> so that no one may boast before him </s>
<s> it is because of him that you are in christ jesus  who has become for us wisdom from god  that is  our righteousness  holiness and redemption </s>
<s> therefore  as it is written   let the one who boasts boast in the lord  </s>
<s> and so it was with me  brothers and sisters  when i came to you  i did not come with eloquence or human wisdom as i proclaimed to you the testimony about god </s>
<s> for i resolved to know nothing while i was with you except jesus christ and him crucified </s>
<s> i came to you in weakness with great fear and trembling </s>
<s> my message and my preaching were not with wise and persuasive words  but with a demonstration of the spirits power </s>
<s> so that your faith might not rest on human wisdom  but on gods power </s>
<s> we do  however  speak a message of wisdom among the mature  but not the wisdom of this age or of the rulers of this age  who are coming to nothing </s>
<s> no  we declare gods wisdom  a mystery that has been hidden and that god destined for our glory before time began </s>
<s> none of the rulers of this age understood it  for if they had  they would not have crucified the lord of glory </s>
<s> however  as it is written   what no eye has seen  what no ear has heard  and what no human mind has conceived  the things god has prepared for those who love him  the spirit searches all things  even the deep things of god </s>
<s> for who knows a persons thoughts except their own spirit within them  in the same way no one knows the thoughts of god except the spirit of god </s>
<s> what we have received is not the spirit of the world  but the spirit who is from god  so that we may understand what god has freely given us </s>
<s> this is what we speak  not in words taught us by human wisdom but in words taught by the spirit  explaining spiritual realities with spirittaught words </s>
<s> the person without the spirit does not accept the things that come from the spirit of god but considers them foolishness  and cannot understand them because they are discerned only through the spirit </s>
<s> the person with the spirit makes judgments about all things  but such a person is not subject to merely human judgments </s>
<s> for   who has known the mind of the lord so as to instruct him  </s>
<s> brothers and sisters  i could not address you as people who live by the spirit but as people who are still worldly  mere infants in christ </s>
<s> i gave you milk  not solid food  for you were not yet ready for it  indeed  you are still not ready </s>
<s> you are still worldly  for since there is jealousy and quarrelling among you  are you not worldly  are you not acting like mere humans </s>
<s> for when one says   i follow paul   and another   i follow apollos   are you not mere human beings </s>
<s> what  after all  is apollos  and what is paul  only servants  through whom you came to believe  as the lord has assigned to each his task </s>
<s> i planted the seed  apollos watered it  but god has been making it grow </s>
<s> so neither the one who plants nor the one who waters is anything  but only god  who makes things grow </s>
<s> the one who plants and the one who waters have one purpose  and they will each be rewarded according to their own labour </s>
<s> for we are fellow workers in gods service  you are gods field  gods building </s>
<s> by the grace god has given me  i laid a foundation as a wise builder  and someone else is building on it  but each one should build with care </s>
<s> for no one can lay any foundation other than the one already laid  which is jesus christ </s>
<s> if anyone builds on this foundation using gold  silver  costly stones  wood  hay or straw </s>
<s> their work will be shown for what it is  because the day will bring it to light  it will be revealed with fire  and the fire will test the quality of each persons work </s>
<s> if what has been built survives  the builder will receive a reward </s>
<s> if it is burned up  the builder will suffer loss but yet will be saved  even though only as one escaping through the flames </s>
<s> dont you know that you yourselves are gods temple and that gods spirit lives among you </s>
<s> if anyone destroys gods temple  god will destroy that person  for gods temple is sacred  and you together are that temple </s>
<s> do not deceive yourselves  if any of you think you are wise by the standards of this age  you should become  fools so that you may become wise </s>
<s> for the wisdom of this world is foolishness in gods sight  as it is written   he catches the wise in their craftiness </s>
<s> and again   the lord knows that the thoughts of the wise are futile  </s>
<s> so then  no more boasting about human leaders  all things are yours </s>
<s> whether paul or apollos or cephas or the world or life or death or the present or the future  all are yours </s>
<s> and you are of christ  and christ is of god </s>
<s> this  then  is how you ought to regard us  as servants of christ and as those entrusted with the mysteries god has revealed </s>
<s> now it is required that those who have been given a trust must prove faithful </s>
<s> i care very little if i am judged by you or by any human court  indeed  i do not even judge myself </s>
<s> my conscience is clear  but that does not make me innocent  it is the lord who judges me </s>
<s> therefore judge nothing before the appointed time  wait until the lord comes  he will bring to light what is hidden in darkness and will expose the motives of the heart  at that time each will receive their praise from god </s>
<s> now  brothers and sisters  i have applied these things to myself and apollos for your benefit  so that you may learn from us the meaning of the saying   do not go beyond what is written   then you will not be puffed up in being a follower of one of us over against the other </s>
<s> for who makes you different from anyone else  what do you have that you did not receive  and if you did receive it  why do you boast as though you did not </s>
<s> already you have all you want  already you have become rich  you have begun to reign  and that without us  how i wish that you really had begun to reign so that we also might reign with you </s>
<s> for it seems to me that god has put us apostles on display at the end of the procession  like those condemned to die in the arena  we have been made a spectacle to the whole universe  to angels as well as to human beings </s>
<s> we are fools for christ  but you are so wise in christ  we are weak  but you are strong  you are honoured  we are dishonoured </s>
<s> to this very hour we go hungry and thirsty  we are in rags  we are brutally treated  we are homeless </s>
<s> we work hard with our own hands  when we are cursed  we bless  when we are persecuted  we endure it </s>
<s> when we are slandered  we answer kindly  we have become the scum of the earth  the garbage of the world  right up to this moment </s>
<s> i am writing this not to shame you but to warn you as my dear children </s>
<s> even if you had ten thousand guardians in christ  you do not have many fathers  for in christ jesus i became your father through the gospel </s>
<s> therefore i urge you to imitate me </s>
<s> for this reason i have sent to you timothy  my son whom i love  who is faithful in the lord  he will remind you of my way of life in christ jesus  which agrees with what i teach everywhere in every church </s>
<s> some of you have become arrogant  as if i were not coming to you </s>
<s> but i will come to you very soon  if the lord is willing  and then i will find out not only how these arrogant people are talking  but what power they have </s>
<s> for the kingdom of god is not a matter of talk but of power </s>
<s> what do you prefer  shall i come to you with a rod of discipline  or shall i come in love and with a gentle spirit </s>
<s> it is actually reported that there is sexual immorality among you  and of a kind that even pagans do not tolerate  a man is sleeping with his fathers wife </s>
<s> and you are proud  shouldnt you rather have gone into mourning and have put out of your fellowship the man who has been doing this </s>
<s> for my part  even though i am not physically present  i am with you in spirit  as one who is present with you in this way  i have already passed judgment in the name of our lord jesus on the one who has been doing this </s>
<s> so when you are assembled and i am with you in spirit  and the power of our lord jesus is present </s>
<s> hand this man over to satan for the destruction of the flesh   so that his spirit may be saved on the day of the lord </s>
<s> your boasting is not good  dont you know that a little yeast leavens the whole batch of dough </s>
<s> get rid of the old yeast  so that you may be a new unleavened batch  as you really are  for christ  our passover lamb  has been sacrificed </s>
<s> therefore let us keep the festival  not with the old bread leavened with malice and wickedness  but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth </s>
<s> i wrote to you in my letter not to associate with sexually immoral people </s>
<s> not at all meaning the people of this world who are immoral  or the greedy and swindlers  or idolaters  in that case you would have to leave this world </s>
<s> but now i am writing to you that you must not associate with anyone who claims to be a brother or sister but is sexually immoral or greedy  an idolater or slanderer  a drunkard or swindler  do not even eat with such people </s>
<s> what business is it of mine to judge those outside the church  are you not to judge those inside </s>
<s> god will judge those outside   expel the wicked person from among you  </s>
<s> if any of you has a dispute with another  do you dare to take it before the ungodly for judgment instead of before the lords people </s>
<s> or do you not know that the lords people will judge the world  and if you are to judge the world  are you not competent to judge trivial cases </s>
<s> do you not know that we will judge angels  how much more the things of this life </s>
<s> therefore  if you have disputes about such matters  do you ask for a ruling from those whose way of life is scorned in the church </s>
<s> i say this to shame you  is it possible that there is nobody among you wise enough to judge a dispute between believers </s>
<s> but instead  one brother takes another to court  and this in front of unbelievers </s>
<s> the very fact that you have lawsuits among you means you have been completely defeated already  why not rather be wronged  why not rather be cheated </s>
<s> instead  you yourselves cheat and do wrong  and you do this to your brothers and sisters </s>
<s> or do you not know that wrongdoers will not inherit the kingdom of god  do not be deceived  neither the sexually immoral nor idolaters nor adulterers nor men who have sex with men</s>
<s> nor thieves nor the greedy nor drunkards nor slanderers nor swindlers will inherit the kingdom of god </s>
<s> and that is what some of you were  but you were washed  you were sanctified  you were justified in the name of the lord jesus christ and by the spirit of our god </s>
<s>  i have the right to do anything   you say  but not everything is beneficial   i have the right to do anything  but i will not be mastered by anything </s>
<s> you say   food for the stomach and the stomach for food  and god will destroy them both   the body  however  is not meant for sexual immorality but for the lord  and the lord for the body </s>
<s> by his power god raised the lord from the dead  and he will raise us also </s>
<s> do you not know that your bodies are members of christ himself  shall i then take the members of christ and unite them with a prostitute  never </s>
<s> do you not know that he who unites himself with a prostitute is one with her in body  for it is said   the two will become one flesh  </s>
<s> but whoever is united with the lord is one with him in spirit </s>
<s> flee from sexual immorality  all other sins a person commits are outside the body  but whoever sins sexually  sins against their own body </s>
<s> do you not know that your bodies are temples of the holy spirit  who is in you  whom you have received from god  you are not your own </s>
<s> you were bought at a price  therefore honour god with your bodies </s>
<s> now for the matters you wrote about   it is good for a man not to have sexual relations with a woman  </s>
<s> but since sexual immorality is occurring  each man should have sexual relations with his own wife  and each woman with her own husband </s>
<s> the husband should fulfil his marital duty to his wife  and likewise the wife to her husband </s>
<s> the wife does not have authority over her own body but yields it to her husband  in the same way  the husband does not have authority over his own body but yields it to his wife </s>
<s> do not deprive each other except perhaps by mutual consent and for a time  so that you may devote yourselves to prayer  then come together again so that satan will not tempt you because of your lack of selfcontrol </s>
<s> i say this as a concession  not as a command </s>
<s> i wish that all of you were as i am  but each of you has your own gift from god  one has this gift  another has that </s>
<s> now to the unmarried and the widows i say  it is good for them to stay unmarried  as i do </s>
<s> but if they cannot control themselves  they should marry  for it is better to marry than to burn with passion </s>
<s> to the married i give this command  not i  but the lord   a wife must not separate from her husband </s>
<s> but if she does  she must remain unmarried or else be reconciled to her husband  and a husband must not divorce his wife </s>
<s> to the rest i say this  i  not the lord   if any brother has a wife who is not a believer and she is willing to live with him  he must not divorce her </s>
<s> and if a woman has a husband who is not a believer and he is willing to live with her  she must not divorce him </s>
<s> for the unbelieving husband has been sanctified through his wife  and the unbelieving wife has been sanctified through her believing husband  otherwise your children would be unclean  but as it is  they are holy </s>
<s> but if the unbeliever leaves  let it be so  the brother or the sister is not bound in such circumstances  god has called us to live in peace </s>
<s> how do you know  wife  whether you will save your husband  or  how do you know  husband  whether you will save your wife </s>
<s> nevertheless  each person should live as a believer in whatever situation the lord has assigned to them  just as god has called them  this is the rule i lay down in all the churches </s>
<s> was a man already circumcised when he was called  he should not become uncircumcised  was a man uncircumcised when he was called  he should not be circumcised </s>
<s> circumcision is nothing and uncircumcision is nothing  keeping gods commands is what counts </s>
<s> each person should remain in the situation they were in when god called them </s>
<s> were you a slave when you were called  dont let it trouble you  although if you can gain your freedom  do so </s>
<s> for the one who was a slave when called to faith in the lord is the lords freed person  similarly  the one who was free when called is christs slave </s>
<s> you were bought at a price  do not become slaves of human beings </s>
<s> brothers and sisters  each person  as responsible to god  should remain in the situation they were in when god called them </s>
<s> now about virgins  i have no command from the lord  but i give a judgment as one who by the lords mercy is trustworthy </s>
<s> because of the present crisis  i think that it is good for a man to remain as he is </s>
<s> are you pledged to a woman  do not seek to be released  are you free from such a commitment  do not look for a wife </s>
<s> but if you do marry  you have not sinned  and if a virgin marries  she has not sinned  but those who marry will face many troubles in this life  and i want to spare you this </s>
<s> what i mean  brothers and sisters  is that the time is short  from now on those who have wives should live as if they do not </s>
<s> those who mourn  as if they did not  those who are happy  as if they were not  those who buy something  as if it were not theirs to keep </s>
<s> those who use the things of the world  as if not engrossed in them  for this world in its present form is passing away </s>
<s> i would like you to be free from concern  an unmarried man is concerned about the lords affairs  how he can please the lord </s>
<s> but a married man is concerned about the affairs of this world  how he can please his wife </s>
<s> and his interests are divided  an unmarried woman or virgin is concerned about the lords affairs  her aim is to be devoted to the lord in both body and spirit  but a married woman is concerned about the affairs of this world  how she can please her husband </s>
<s> i am saying this for your own good  not to restrict you  but that you may live in a right way in undivided devotion to the lord </s>
<s> if anyone is worried that he might not be acting honourably towards the virgin he is engaged to  and if his passions are too strong and he feels he ought to marry  he should do as he wants  he is not sinning  they should get married </s>
<s> but the man who has settled the matter in his own mind  who is under no compulsion but has control over his own will  and who has made up his mind not to marry the virgin  this man also does the right thing </s>
<s> so then  he who marries the virgin does right  but he who does not marry her does better </s>
<s> a woman is bound to her husband as long as he lives  but if her husband dies  she is free to marry anyone she wishes  but he must belong to the lord </s>
<s> in my judgment  she is happier if she stays as she is  and i think that i too have the spirit of god </s>
<s> now about food sacrificed to idols  we know that  we all possess knowledge   but knowledge puffs up while love builds up </s>
<s> those who think they know something do not yet know as they ought to know </s>
<s> but whoever loves god is known by god </s>
<s> so then  about eating food sacrificed to idols  we know that  an idol is nothing at all in the world and that  there is no god but one  </s>
<s> for even if there are socalled gods  whether in heaven or on earth  as indeed there are many  gods and many  lords  </s>
<s> yet for us there is but one god  the father  from whom all things came and for whom we live  and there is but one lord  jesus christ  through whom all things came and through whom we live </s>
<s> but not everyone possesses this knowledge  some people are still so accustomed to idols that when they eat sacrificial food they think of it as having been sacrificed to a god  and since their conscience is weak  it is defiled </s>
<s> but food does not bring us near to god  we are no worse if we do not eat  and no better if we do </s>
<s> be careful  however  that the exercise of your rights does not become a stumblingblock to the weak </s>
<s> for if someone with a weak conscience sees you  with all your knowledge  eating in an idols temple  wont that person be emboldened to eat what is sacrificed to idols </s>
<s> so this weak brother or sister  for whom christ died  is destroyed by your knowledge </s>
<s> when you sin against them in this way and wound their weak conscience  you sin against christ </s>
<s> therefore  if what i eat causes my brother or sister to fall into sin  i will never eat meat again  so that i will not cause them to fall </s>
<s> am i not free  am i not an apostle  have i not seen jesus our lord  are you not the result of my work in the lord </s>
<s> even though i may not be an apostle to others  surely i am to you  for you are the seal of my apostleship in the lord </s>
<s> this is my defence to those who sit in judgment on me </s>
<s> dont we have the right to food and drink </s>
<s> dont we have the right to take a believing wife along with us  as do the other apostles and the lords brothers and cephas </s>
<s> or is it only i and barnabas who lack the right to not work for a living </s>
<s> who serves as a soldier at his own expense  who plants a vineyard and does not eat its grapes  who tends a flock and does not drink the milk </s>
<s> do i say this merely on human authority  doesnt the law say the same thing </s>
<s> for it is written in the law of moses   do not muzzle an ox while it is treading out the grain   is it about oxen that god is concerned </s>
<s> surely he says this for us  doesnt he  yes  this was written for us  because whoever ploughs and threshes should be able to do so in the hope of sharing in the harvest </s>
<s> if we have sown spiritual seed among you  is it too much if we reap a material harvest from you </s>
<s> if others have this right of support from you  shouldnt we have it all the more  but we did not use this right  on the contrary  we put up with anything rather than hinder the gospel of christ </s>
<s> dont you know that those who serve in the temple get their food from the temple  and that those who serve at the altar share in what is offered on the altar </s>
<s> in the same way  the lord has commanded that those who preach the gospel should receive their living from the gospel </s>
<s> but i have not used any of these rights  and i am not writing this in the hope that you will do such things for me  for i would rather die than allow anyone to deprive me of this boast </s>
<s> for when i preach the gospel  i cannot boast  since i am compelled to preach  woe to me if i do not preach the gospel </s>
<s> if i preach voluntarily  i have a reward  if not voluntarily  i am simply discharging the trust committed to me </s>
<s> what then is my reward  just this  that in preaching the gospel i may offer it free of charge  and so not make full use of my rights as a preacher of the gospel </s>
<s> though i am free and belong to no one  i have made myself a slave to everyone  to win as many as possible </s>
<s> to the jews i became like a jew  to win the jews  to those under the law i became like one under the law  though i myself am not under the law   so as to win those under the law </s>
<s> to those not having the law i became like one not having the law  though i am not free from gods law but am under christs law   so as to win those not having the law </s>
<s> to the weak i became weak  to win the weak  i have become all things to all people so that by all possible means i might save some </s>
<s> i do all this for the sake of the gospel  that i may share in its blessings </s>
<s> do you not know that in a race all the runners run  but only one gets the prize  run in such a way as to get the prize </s>
<s> everyone who competes in the games goes into strict training  they do it to get a crown that will not last  but we do it to get a crown that will last for ever </s>
<s> therefore i do not run like someone running aimlessly  i do not fight like a boxer beating the air </s>
<s> no  i strike a blow to my body and make it my slave so that after i have preached to others  i myself will not be disqualified for the prize </s>
<s> for i do not want you to be ignorant of the fact  brothers and sisters  that our ancestors were all under the cloud and that they all passed through the sea </s>
<s> they were all baptised into moses in the cloud and in the sea </s>
<s> they all ate the same spiritual food</s>
<s> and drank the same spiritual drink  for they drank from the spiritual rock that accompanied them  and that rock was christ </s>
<s> nevertheless  god was not pleased with most of them  their bodies were scattered in the wilderness </s>
<s> now these things occurred as examples to keep us from setting our hearts on evil things as they did </s>
<s> do not be idolaters  as some of them were  as it is written   the people sat down to eat and drink and got up to indulge in revelry  </s>
<s> we should not commit sexual immorality  as some of them did  and in one day twentythree thousand of them died </s>
<s> we should not test christ  as some of them did  and were killed by snakes </s>
<s> and do not grumble  as some of them did  and were killed by the destroying angel </s>
<s> these things happened to them as examples and were written down as warnings for us  on whom the culmination of the ages has come </s>
<s> so  if you think you are standing firm  be careful that you dont fall </s>
<s> no temptation has overtaken you except what is common to mankind  and god is faithful  he will not let you be tempted beyond what you can bear  but when you are tempted  he will also provide a way out so that you can endure it </s>
<s> therefore  my dear friends  flee from idolatry </s>
<s> i speak to sensible people  judge for yourselves what i say </s>
<s> is not the cup of thanksgiving for which we give thanks a participation in the blood of christ  and is not the bread that we break a participation in the body of christ </s>
<s> because there is one loaf  we  who are many  are one body  for we all share the one loaf </s>
<s> consider the people of israel  do not those who eat the sacrifices participate in the altar </s>
<s> do i mean then that food sacrificed to an idol is anything  or that an idol is anything </s>
<s> no  but the sacrifices of pagans are offered to demons  not to god  and i do not want you to be participants with demons </s>
<s> you cannot drink the cup of the lord and the cup of demons too  you cannot have a part in both the lords table and the table of demons </s>
<s> are we trying to arouse the lords jealousy  are we stronger than he </s>
<s>  i have the right to do anything   you say  but not everything is beneficial   i have the right to do anything  but not everything is constructive </s>
<s> no one should seek their own good  but the good of others </s>
<s> eat anything sold in the meat market without raising questions of conscience </s>
<s> for   the earth is the lords  and everything in it  </s>
<s> if an unbeliever invites you to a meal and you want to go  eat whatever is put before you without raising questions of conscience </s>
<s> but if someone says to you   this has been offered in sacrifice   then do not eat it  both for the sake of the one who told you and for the sake of conscience </s>
<s> i am referring to the other persons conscience  not yours  for why is my freedom being judged by anothers conscience </s>
<s> if i take part in the meal with thankfulness  why am i denounced because of something i thank god for </s>
<s> so whether you eat or drink or whatever you do  do it all for the glory of god </s>
<s> do not cause anyone to stumble  whether jews  greeks or the church of god </s>
<s> even as i try to please everyone in every way  for i am not seeking my own good but the good of many  so that they may be saved </s>
<s> follow my example  as i follow the example of christ </s>
<s> i praise you for remembering me in everything and for holding to the traditions just as i passed them on to you </s>
<s> but i want you to realise that the head of every man is christ  and the head of the woman is man  and the head of christ is god </s>
<s> every man who prays or prophesies with his head covered dishonours his head </s>
<s> but every woman who prays or prophesies with her head uncovered dishonours her head  it is the same as having her head shaved </s>
<s> for if a woman does not cover her head  she might as well have her hair cut off  but if it is a disgrace for a woman to have her hair cut off or her head shaved  then she should cover her head </s>
<s> a man ought not to cover his head  since he is the image and glory of god  but woman is the glory of man </s>
<s> for man did not come from woman  but woman from man </s>
<s> neither was man created for woman  but woman for man </s>
<s> it is for this reason that a woman ought to have authority over her own head  because of the angels </s>
<s> nevertheless  in the lord woman is not independent of man  nor is man independent of woman </s>
<s> for as woman came from man  so also man is born of woman  but everything comes from god </s>
<s> judge for yourselves  is it proper for a woman to pray to god with her head uncovered </s>
<s> does not the very nature of things teach you that if a man has long hair  it is a disgrace to him </s>
<s> but that if a woman has long hair  it is her glory  for long hair is given to her as a covering </s>
<s> if anyone wants to be contentious about this  we have no other practice  nor do the churches of god </s>
<s> in the following directives i have no praise for you  for your meetings do more harm than good </s>
<s> in the first place  i hear that when you come together as a church  there are divisions among you  and to some extent i believe it </s>
<s> no doubt there have to be differences among you to show which of you have gods approval </s>
<s> so then  when you come together  it is not the lords supper you eat </s>
<s> for when you are eating  some of you go ahead with your own private suppers  as a result  one person remains hungry and another gets drunk </s>
<s> dont you have homes to eat and drink in  or do you despise the church of god by humiliating those who have nothing  what shall i say to you  shall i praise you  certainly not in this matter </s>
<s> for i received from the lord what i also passed on to you  the lord jesus  on the night he was betrayed  took bread </s>
<s> and when he had given thanks  he broke it and said   this is my body  which is for you  do this in remembrance of me  </s>
<s> in the same way  after supper he took the cup  saying   this cup is the new covenant in my blood  do this  whenever you drink it  in remembrance of me  </s>
<s> for whenever you eat this bread and drink this cup  you proclaim the lords death until he comes </s>
<s> so then  whoever eats the bread or drinks the cup of the lord in an unworthy manner will be guilty of sinning against the body and blood of the lord </s>
<s> everyone ought to examine themselves before they eat of the bread and drink from the cup </s>
<s> for those who eat and drink without discerning the body of christ eat and drink judgment on themselves </s>
<s> that is why many among you are weak and ill  and a number of you have fallen asleep </s>
<s> but if we were more discerning with regard to ourselves  we would not come under such judgment </s>
<s> nevertheless  when we are judged in this way by the lord  we are being disciplined so that we will not be finally condemned with the world </s>
<s> so then  my brothers and sisters  when you gather to eat  you should all eat together </s>
<s> anyone who is hungry should eat something at home  so that when you meet together it may not result in judgment  and when i come i will give further instructions </s>
<s> now about the gifts of the spirit  brothers and sisters  i do not want you to be uninformed </s>
<s> you know that when you were pagans  somehow or other you were influenced and led astray to dumb idols </s>
<s> therefore i want you to know that no one who is speaking by the spirit of god says   jesus be cursed   and no one can say   jesus is lord   except by the holy spirit </s>
<s> there are different kinds of gifts  but the same spirit distributes them </s>
<s> there are different kinds of service  but the same lord </s>
<s> there are different kinds of working  but in all of them and in everyone it is the same god at work </s>
<s> now to each one the manifestation of the spirit is given for the common good </s>
<s> to one there is given through the spirit a message of wisdom  to another a message of knowledge by means of the same spirit </s>
<s> to another faith by the same spirit  to another gifts of healing by that one spirit </s>
<s> to another miraculous powers  to another prophecy  to another distinguishing between spirits  to another speaking in different kinds of tongues  and to still another the interpretation of tongues </s>
<s> all these are the work of one and the same spirit  and he distributes them to each one  just as he determines </s>
<s> just as a body  though one  has many parts  but all its many parts form one body  so it is with christ </s>
<s> for we were all baptised by one spirit so as to form one body  whether jews or gentiles  slave or free  and we were all given the one spirit to drink </s>
<s> and so the body is not made up of one part but of many </s>
<s> now if the foot should say   because i am not a hand  i do not belong to the body   it would not for that reason stop being part of the body </s>
<s> and if the ear should say   because i am not an eye  i do not belong to the body   it would not for that reason stop being part of the body </s>
<s> if the whole body were an eye  where would the sense of hearing be  if the whole body were an ear  where would the sense of smell be </s>
<s> but in fact god has placed the parts in the body  every one of them  just as he wanted them to be </s>
<s> if they were all one part  where would the body be </s>
<s> as it is  there are many parts  but one body </s>
<s> the eye cannot say to the hand   i dont need you   and the head cannot say to the feet   i dont need you  </s>
<s> on the contrary  those parts of the body that seem to be weaker are indispensable </s>
<s> and the parts that we think are less honourable we treat with special honour  and the parts that are unpresentable are treated with special modesty </s>
<s> while our presentable parts need no special treatment  but god has put the body together  giving greater honour to the parts that lacked it </s>
<s> so that there should be no division in the body  but that its parts should have equal concern for each other </s>
<s> if one part suffers  every part suffers with it  if one part is honoured  every part rejoices with it </s>
<s> now you are the body of christ  and each one of you is a part of it </s>
<s> and god has placed in the church first of all apostles  second prophets  third teachers  then miracles  then gifts of healing  of helping  of guidance  and of different kinds of tongues </s>
<s> are all apostles  are all prophets  are all teachers  do all work miracles </s>
<s> do all have gifts of healing  do all speak in tongues  do all interpret </s>
<s> now eagerly desire the greater gifts  and yet i will show you the most excellent way </s>
<s> if i speak in the tongues of men or of angels  but do not have love  i am only a resounding gong or a clanging cymbal </s>
<s> if i have the gift of prophecy and can fathom all mysteries and all knowledge  and if i have a faith that can move mountains  but do not have love  i am nothing </s>
<s> if i give all i possess to the poor and give over my body to hardship that i may boast  but do not have love  i gain nothing </s>
<s> love is patient  love is kind  it does not envy  it does not boast  it is not proud </s>
<s> it does not dishonour others  it is not selfseeking  it is not easily angered  it keeps no record of wrongs </s>
<s> love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth </s>
<s> it always protects  always trusts  always hopes  always perseveres </s>
<s> love never fails  but where there are prophecies  they will cease  where there are tongues  they will be stilled  where there is knowledge  it will pass away </s>
<s> for we know in part and we prophesy in part </s>
<s> but when completeness comes  what is in part disappears </s>
<s> when i was a child  i talked like a child  i thought like a child  i reasoned like a child  when i became a man  i put the ways of childhood behind me </s>
<s> for now we see only a reflection as in a mirror  then we shall see face to face  now i know in part  then i shall know fully  even as i am fully known </s>
<s> and now these three remain  faith  hope and love  but the greatest of these is love </s>
<s> follow the way of love and eagerly desire gifts of the spirit  especially prophecy </s>
<s> for anyone who speaks in a tongue does not speak to people but to god  indeed  no one understands them  they utter mysteries by the spirit </s>
<s> but the one who prophesies speaks to people for their strengthening  encouraging and comfort </s>
<s> anyone who speaks in a tongue edifies themselves  but the one who prophesies edifies the church </s>
<s> i would like every one of you to speak in tongues  but even more to prophesy  the one who prophesies is greater than the one who speaks in tongues  unless someone interprets  so that the church may be edified </s>
<s> now  brothers and sisters  if i come to you and speak in tongues  what good will i be to you  unless i bring you some revelation or knowledge or prophecy or word of instruction </s>
<s> even in the case of lifeless things that make sounds  such as the pipe or harp  how will anyone know what tune is being played unless there is a distinction in the notes </s>
<s> again  if the trumpet does not sound a clear call  who will get ready for battle </s>
<s> so it is with you  unless you speak intelligible words with your tongue  how will anyone know what you are saying  you will just be speaking into the air </s>
<s> undoubtedly there are all sorts of languages in the world  yet none of them is without meaning </s>
<s> if then i do not grasp the meaning of what someone is saying  i am a foreigner to the speaker  and the speaker is a foreigner to me </s>
<s> so it is with you  since you are eager for gifts of the spirit  try to excel in those that build up the church </s>
<s> for this reason the one who speaks in a tongue should pray that they may interpret what they say </s>
<s> for if i pray in a tongue  my spirit prays  but my mind is unfruitful </s>
<s> so what shall i do  i will pray with my spirit  but i will also pray with my understanding  i will sing with my spirit  but i will also sing with my understanding </s>
<s> otherwise when you are praising god in the spirit  how can someone else  who is now put in the position of an enquirer  say  amen to your thanksgiving  since they do not know what you are saying </s>
<s> you are giving thanks well enough  but no one else is edified </s>
<s> i thank god that i speak in tongues more than all of you </s>
<s> but in the church i would rather speak five intelligible words to instruct others than ten thousand words in a tongue </s>
<s> brothers and sisters  stop thinking like children  in regard to evil be infants  but in your thinking be adults </s>
<s> in the law it is written   with other tongues and through the lips of foreigners i will speak to this people  but even then they will not listen to me </s>
<s> tongues  then  are a sign  not for believers but for unbelievers  prophecy  however  is not for unbelievers but for believers </s>
<s> so if the whole church comes together and everyone speaks in tongues  and enquirers or unbelievers come in  will they not say that you are out of your mind </s>
<s> but if an unbeliever or an enquirer comes in while everyone is prophesying  they are convicted of sin and are brought under judgment by all </s>
<s> as the secrets of their hearts are laid bare  so they will fall down and worship god  exclaiming   god is really among you  </s>
<s> what then shall we say  brothers and sisters  when you come together  each of you has a hymn  or a word of instruction  a revelation  a tongue or an interpretation  everything must be done so that the church may be built up </s>
<s> if anyone speaks in a tongue  two  or at the most three  should speak  one at a time  and someone must interpret </s>
<s> if there is no interpreter  the speaker should keep quiet in the church and speak to himself and to god </s>
<s> two or three prophets should speak  and the others should weigh carefully what is said </s>
<s> and if a revelation comes to someone who is sitting down  the first speaker should stop </s>
<s> for you can all prophesy in turn so that everyone may be instructed and encouraged </s>
<s> the spirits of prophets are subject to the control of prophets </s>
<s> for god is not a god of disorder but of peace  as in all the congregations of the lords people </s>
<s> women should remain silent in the churches  they are not allowed to speak  but must be in submission  as the law says </s>
<s> if they want to enquire about something  they should ask their own husbands at home  for it is disgraceful for a woman to speak in the church </s>
<s> or did the word of god originate with you  or are you the only people it has reached </s>
<s> if anyone thinks they are a prophet or otherwise gifted by the spirit  let them acknowledge that what i am writing to you is the lords command </s>
<s> but if anyone ignores this  they will themselves be ignored </s>
<s> therefore  my brothers and sisters  be eager to prophesy  and do not forbid speaking in tongues </s>
<s> but everything should be done in a fitting and orderly way </s>
<s> now  brothers and sisters  i want to remind you of the gospel i preached to you  which you received and on which you have taken your stand </s>
<s> by this gospel you are saved  if you hold firmly to the word i preached to you  otherwise  you have believed in vain </s>
<s> for what i received i passed on to you as of first importance  that christ died for our sins according to the scriptures </s>
<s> that he was buried  that he was raised on the third day according to the scriptures </s>
<s> and that he appeared to cephas  and then to the twelve </s>
<s> after that  he appeared to more than five hundred of the brothers and sisters at the same time  most of whom are still living  though some have fallen asleep </s>
<s> then he appeared to james  then to all the apostles </s>
<s> and last of all he appeared to me also  as to one abnormally born </s>
<s> for i am the least of the apostles and do not even deserve to be called an apostle  because i persecuted the church of god </s>
<s> but by the grace of god i am what i am  and his grace to me was not without effect  no  i worked harder than all of them  yet not i  but the grace of god that was with me </s>
<s> whether  then  it is i or they  this is what we preach  and this is what you believed </s>
<s> but if it is preached that christ has been raised from the dead  how can some of you say that there is no resurrection of the dead </s>
<s> if there is no resurrection of the dead  then not even christ has been raised </s>
<s> and if christ has not been raised  our preaching is useless and so is your faith </s>
<s> more than that  we are then found to be false witnesses about god  for we have testified about god that he raised christ from the dead  but he did not raise him if in fact the dead are not raised </s>
<s> for if the dead are not raised  then christ has not been raised either </s>
<s> and if christ has not been raised  your faith is futile  you are still in your sins </s>
<s> then those also who have fallen asleep in christ are lost </s>
<s> if only for this life we have hope in christ  we are of all people most to be pitied </s>
<s> but christ has indeed been raised from the dead  the firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep </s>
<s> for since death came through a man  the resurrection of the dead comes also through a man </s>
<s> for as in adam all die  so in christ all will be made alive </s>
<s> but each in turn  christ  the firstfruits  then  when he comes  those who belong to him </s>
<s> then the end will come  when he hands over the kingdom to god the father after he has destroyed all dominion  authority and power </s>
<s> for he must reign until he has put all his enemies under his feet </s>
<s> the last enemy to be destroyed is death </s>
<s> for he  has put everything under his feet  now when it says that  everything has been put under him  it is clear that this does not include god himself  who put everything under christ </s>
<s> when he has done this  then the son himself will be made subject to him who put everything under him  so that god may be all in all </s>
<s> now if there is no resurrection  what will those do who are baptised for the dead  if the dead are not raised at all  why are people baptised for them </s>
<s> and as for us  why do we endanger ourselves every hour </s>
<s> i face death every day  yes  just as surely as i boast about you in christ jesus our lord </s>
<s> if i fought wild beasts in ephesus with no more than human hopes  what have i gained  if the dead are not raised   let us eat and drink  for tomorrow we die  </s>
<s> but someone will ask   how are the dead raised  with what kind of body will they come  </s>
<s> how foolish  what you sow does not come to life unless it dies </s>
<s> when you sow  you do not plant the body that will be  but just a seed  perhaps of wheat or of something else </s>
<s> but god gives it a body as he has determined  and to each kind of seed he gives its own body </s>
<s> not all flesh is the same  people have one kind of flesh  animals have another  birds another and fish another </s>
<s> there are also heavenly bodies and there are earthly bodies  but the splendour of the heavenly bodies is one kind  and the splendour of the earthly bodies is another </s>
<s> the sun has one kind of splendour  the moon another and the stars another  and star differs from star in splendour </s>
<s> so will it be with the resurrection of the dead  the body that is sown is perishable  it is raised imperishable </s>
<s> it is sown in dishonour  it is raised in glory  it is sown in weakness  it is raised in power </s>
<s> it is sown a natural body  it is raised a spiritual body  if there is a natural body  there is also a spiritual body </s>
<s> so it is written   the first man adam became a living being  the last adam  a lifegiving spirit </s>
<s> the spiritual did not come first  but the natural  and after that the spiritual </s>
<s> the first man was of the dust of the earth  the second man is of heaven </s>
<s> as was the earthly man  so are those who are of the earth  and as is the heavenly man  so also are those who are of heaven </s>
<s> and just as we have borne the image of the earthly man  so shall we bear the image of the heavenly man </s>
<s> i declare to you  brothers and sisters  that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of god  nor does the perishable inherit the imperishable </s>
<s> listen  i tell you a mystery  we will not all sleep  but we will all be changed </s>
<s> in a flash  in the twinkling of an eye  at the last trumpet  for the trumpet will sound  the dead will be raised imperishable  and we will be changed </s>
<s> for the perishable must clothe itself with the imperishable  and the mortal with immortality </s>
<s> when the perishable has been clothed with the imperishable  and the mortal with immortality  then the saying that is written will come true   death has been swallowed up in victory  </s>
<s>  where  o death  is your victory  where  o death  is your sting  </s>
<s> therefore  my dear brothers and sisters  stand firm  let nothing move you  always give yourselves fully to the work of the lord  because you know that your labour in the lord is not in vain </s>
<s> now about the collection for the lords people  do what i told the galatian churches to do </s>
<s> on the first day of every week  each one of you should set aside a sum of money in keeping with your income  saving it up  so that when i come no collections will have to be made </s>
<s> then  when i arrive  i will give letters of introduction to the men you approve and send them with your gift to jerusalem </s>
<s> if it seems advisable for me to go also  they will accompany me </s>
<s> after i go through macedonia  i will come to you  for i will be going through macedonia </s>
<s> perhaps i will stay with you for a while  or even spend the winter  so that you can help me on my journey  wherever i go </s>
<s> for i do not want to see you now and make only a passing visit  i hope to spend some time with you  if the lord permits </s>
<s> but i will stay on at ephesus until pentecost </s>
<s> because a great door for effective work has opened to me  and there are many who oppose me </s>
<s> when timothy comes  see to it that he has nothing to fear while he is with you  for he is carrying on the work of the lord  just as i am </s>
<s> no one  then  should treat him with contempt  send him on his way in peace so that he may return to me  i am expecting him along with the brothers </s>
<s> now about our brother apollos  i strongly urged him to go to you with the brothers  he was quite unwilling to go now  but he will go when he has the opportunity </s>
<s> be on your guard  stand firm in the faith  be courageous  be strong </s>
<s> do everything in love </s>
<s> you know that the household of stephanas were the first converts in achaia  and they have devoted themselves to the service of the lords people  i urge you  brothers and sisters </s>
<s> to submit to such people and to everyone who joins in the work and labours at it </s>
<s> i was glad when stephanas  fortunatus and achaicus arrived  because they have supplied what was lacking from you </s>
<s> for they refreshed my spirit and yours also  such men deserve recognition </s>
<s> the churches in the province of asia send you greetings  aquila and priscilla greet you warmly in the lord  and so does the church that meets at their house </s>
<s> all the brothers and sisters here send you greetings  greet one another with a holy kiss </s>
<s> i  paul  write this greeting in my own hand </s>
<s> if anyone does not love the lord  let that person be cursed  come  lord </s>
<s> the grace of the lord jesus be with you </s>
<s> my love to all of you in christ jesus  amen </s>
<s> paul  an apostle of christ jesus by the will of god  and timothy our brother  to the church of god in corinth  together with all his holy people throughout achaia </s>
<s> grace and peace to you from god our father and the lord jesus christ </s>
<s> praise be to the god and father of our lord jesus christ  the father of compassion and the god of all comfort </s>
<s> who comforts us in all our troubles  so that we can comfort those in any trouble with the comfort we ourselves receive from god </s>
<s> for just as we share abundantly in the sufferings of christ  so also our comfort abounds through christ </s>
<s> if we are distressed  it is for your comfort and salvation  if we are comforted  it is for your comfort  which produces in you patient endurance of the same sufferings we suffer </s>
<s> and our hope for you is firm  because we know that just as you share in our sufferings  so also you share in our comfort </s>
<s> we do not want you to be uninformed  brothers and sisters  about the troubles we experienced in the province of asia  we were under great pressure  far beyond our ability to endure  so that we despaired of life itself </s>
<s> indeed  we felt we had received the sentence of death  but this happened that we might not rely on ourselves but on god  who raises the dead </s>
<s> he has delivered us from such a deadly peril  and he will deliver us again  on him we have set our hope that he will continue to deliver us </s>
<s> as you help us by your prayers  then many will give thanks on our behalf for the gracious favour granted us in answer to the prayers of many </s>
<s> now this is our boast  our conscience testifies that we have conducted ourselves in the world  and especially in our relations with you  with integrity and godly sincerity  we have done so  relying not on worldly wisdom but on gods grace </s>
<s> for we do not write to you anything you cannot read or understand  and i hope that </s>
<s> as you have understood us in part  you will come to understand fully that you can boast of us just as we will boast of you in the day of the lord jesus </s>
<s> because i was confident of this  i wanted to visit you first so that you might benefit twice </s>
<s> i wanted to visit you on my way to macedonia and to come back to you from macedonia  and then to let you send me on my way to judea </s>
<s> was i fickle when i intended to do this  or do i make my plans in a worldly manner so that in the same breath i say both  yes  yes and  no  no </s>
<s> but as surely as god is faithful  our message to you is not  yes and  no </s>
<s> for the son of god  jesus christ  who was preached among you by us  by me  silas and timothy  was not  yes and  no  but in him it has always been  yes </s>
<s> for no matter how many promises god has made  they are  yes in christ  and so through him the  amen is spoken by us to the glory of god </s>
<s> now it is god who makes both us and you stand firm in christ  he anointed us </s>
<s> set his seal of ownership on us  and put his spirit in our hearts as a deposit  guaranteeing what is to come </s>
<s> i call god as my witness  and i stake my life on it  that it was in order to spare you that i did not return to corinth </s>
<s> not that we lord it over your faith  but we work with you for your joy  because it is by faith you stand firm </s>
<s> so i made up my mind that i would not make another painful visit to you </s>
<s> for if i grieve you  who is left to make me glad but you whom i have grieved </s>
<s> i wrote as i did  so that when i came i would not be distressed by those who should have made me rejoice  i had confidence in all of you  that you would all share my joy </s>
<s> for i wrote to you out of great distress and anguish of heart and with many tears  not to grieve you but to let you know the depth of my love for you </s>
<s> if anyone has caused grief  he has not so much grieved me as he has grieved all of you to some extent  not to put it too severely </s>
<s> the punishment inflicted on him by the majority is sufficient </s>
<s> now instead  you ought to forgive and comfort him  so that he will not be overwhelmed by excessive sorrow </s>
<s> i urge you  therefore  to reaffirm your love for him </s>
<s> another reason i wrote to you was to see if you would stand the test and be obedient in everything </s>
<s> anyone you forgive  i also forgive  and what i have forgiven  if there was anything to forgive  i have forgiven in the sight of christ for your sake </s>
<s> in order that satan might not outwit us  for we are not unaware of his schemes </s>
<s> now when i went to troas to preach the gospel of christ and found that the lord had opened a door for me </s>
<s> i still had no peace of mind  because i did not find my brother titus there  so i said goodbye to them and went on to macedonia </s>
<s> but thanks be to god  who always leads us as captives in christs triumphal procession and uses us to spread the aroma of the knowledge of him everywhere </s>
<s> for we are to god the pleasing aroma of christ among those who are being saved and those who are perishing </s>
<s> to the one we are an aroma that brings death  to the other  an aroma that brings life  and who is equal to such a task </s>
<s> unlike so many  we do not peddle the word of god for profit  on the contrary  in christ we speak before god with sincerity  as those sent from god </s>
<s> are we beginning to commend ourselves again  or do we need  like some people  letters of recommendation to you or from you </s>
<s> you yourselves are our letter  written on our hearts  known and read by everyone </s>
<s> you show that you are a letter from christ  the result of our ministry  written not with ink but with the spirit of the living god  not on tablets of stone but on tablets of human hearts </s>
<s> such confidence we have through christ before god </s>
<s> not that we are competent in ourselves to claim anything for ourselves  but our competence comes from god </s>
<s> he has made us competent as ministers of a new covenant  not of the letter but of the spirit  for the letter kills  but the spirit gives life </s>
<s> now if the ministry that brought death  which was engraved in letters on stone  came with glory  so that the israelites could not look steadily at the face of moses because of its glory  transitory though it was </s>
<s> will not the ministry of the spirit be even more glorious </s>
<s> if the ministry that brought condemnation was glorious  how much more glorious is the ministry that brings righteousness </s>
<s> for what was glorious has no glory now in comparison with the surpassing glory </s>
<s> and if what was transitory came with glory  how much greater is the glory of that which lasts </s>
<s> therefore  since we have such a hope  we are very bold </s>
<s> we are not like moses  who would put a veil over his face to prevent the israelites from seeing the end of what was passing away </s>
<s> but their minds were made dull  for to this day the same veil remains when the old covenant is read  it has not been removed  because only in christ is it taken away </s>
<s> even to this day when moses is read  a veil covers their hearts </s>
<s> but whenever anyone turns to the lord  the veil is taken away </s>
<s> now the lord is the spirit  and where the spirit of the lord is  there is freedom </s>
<s> and we all  who with unveiled faces contemplate the lords glory  are being transformed into his image with everincreasing glory  which comes from the lord  who is the spirit </s>
<s> therefore  since through gods mercy we have this ministry  we do not lose heart </s>
<s> rather  we have renounced secret and shameful ways  we do not use deception  nor do we distort the word of god  on the contrary  by setting forth the truth plainly we commend ourselves to everyones conscience in the sight of god </s>
<s> and even if our gospel is veiled  it is veiled to those who are perishing </s>
<s> the god of this age has blinded the minds of unbelievers  so that they cannot see the light of the gospel that displays the glory of christ  who is the image of god </s>
<s> for what we preach is not ourselves  but jesus christ as lord  and ourselves as your servants for jesus sake </s>
<s> for god  who said   let light shine out of darkness   made his light shine in our hearts to give us the light of the knowledge of gods glory displayed in the face of christ </s>
<s> but we have this treasure in jars of clay to show that this allsurpassing power is from god and not from us </s>
<s> we are hard pressed on every side  but not crushed  perplexed  but not in despair </s>
<s> persecuted  but not abandoned  struck down  but not destroyed </s>
<s> we always carry around in our body the death of jesus  so that the life of jesus may also be revealed in our body </s>
<s> for we who are alive are always being given over to death for jesus sake  so that his life may also be revealed in our mortal body </s>
<s> so then  death is at work in us  but life is at work in you </s>
<s> it is written   i believed  therefore i have spoken   since we have that same spirit of faith  we also believe and therefore speak </s>
<s> because we know that the one who raised the lord jesus from the dead will also raise us with jesus and present us with you to himself </s>
<s> all this is for your benefit  so that the grace that is reaching more and more people may cause thanksgiving to overflow to the glory of god </s>
<s> therefore we do not lose heart  though outwardly we are wasting away  yet inwardly we are being renewed day by day </s>
<s> for our light and momentary troubles are achieving for us an eternal glory that far outweighs them all </s>
<s> so we fix our eyes not on what is seen  but on what is unseen  since what is seen is temporary  but what is unseen is eternal </s>
<s> for we know that if the earthly tent we live in is destroyed  we have a building from god  an eternal house in heaven  not built by human hands </s>
<s> meanwhile we groan  longing to be clothed instead with our heavenly dwelling </s>
<s> because when we are clothed  we will not be found naked </s>
<s> for while we are in this tent  we groan and are burdened  because we do not wish to be unclothed but to be clothed instead with our heavenly dwelling  so that what is mortal may be swallowed up by life </s>
<s> now the one who has fashioned us for this very purpose is god  who has given us the spirit as a deposit  guaranteeing what is to come </s>
<s> therefore we are always confident and know that as long as we are at home in the body we are away from the lord </s>
<s> for we live by faith  not by sight </s>
<s> we are confident  i say  and would prefer to be away from the body and at home with the lord </s>
<s> so we make it our goal to please him  whether we are at home in the body or away from it </s>
<s> for we must all appear before the judgment seat of christ  so that each of us may receive what is due to us for the things done while in the body  whether good or bad </s>
<s> since  then  we know what it is to fear the lord  we try to persuade others  what we are is plain to god  and i hope it is also plain to your conscience </s>
<s> we are not trying to commend ourselves to you again  but are giving you an opportunity to take pride in us  so that you can answer those who take pride in what is seen rather than in what is in the heart </s>
<s> if we are  out of our mind   as some say  it is for god  if we are in our right mind  it is for you </s>
<s> for christs love compels us  because we are convinced that one died for all  and therefore all died </s>
<s> and he died for all  that those who live should no longer live for themselves but for him who died for them and was raised again </s>
<s> so from now on we regard no one from a worldly point of view  though we once regarded christ in this way  we do so no longer </s>
<s> therefore  if anyone is in christ  the new creation has come  the old has gone  the new is here </s>
<s> all this is from god  who reconciled us to himself through christ and gave us the ministry of reconciliation </s>
<s> that god was reconciling the world to himself in christ  not counting peoples sins against them  and he has committed to us the message of reconciliation </s>
<s> we are therefore christs ambassadors  as though god were making his appeal through us  we implore you on christs behalf  be reconciled to god </s>
<s> god made him who had no sin to be sin for us  so that in him we might become the righteousness of god </s>
<s> as gods fellow workers we urge you not to receive gods grace in vain </s>
<s> for he says   in the time of my favour i heard you  and in the day of salvation i helped you  </s>
<s> we put no stumblingblock in anyones path  so that our ministry will not be discredited </s>
<s> rather  as servants of god we commend ourselves in every way  in great endurance  in troubles  hardships and distresses </s>
<s> in beatings  imprisonments and riots  in hard work  sleepless nights and hunger </s>
<s> in purity  understanding  patience and kindness  in the holy spirit and in sincere love </s>
<s> in truthful speech and in the power of god  with weapons of righteousness in the right hand and in the left </s>
<s> through glory and dishonour  bad report and good report  genuine  yet regarded as impostors </s>
<s> known  yet regarded as unknown  dying  and yet we live on  beaten  and yet not killed </s>
<s> sorrowful  yet always rejoicing  poor  yet making many rich  having nothing  and yet possessing everything </s>
<s> we have spoken freely to you  corinthians  and opened wide our hearts to you </s>
<s> we are not withholding our affection from you  but you are withholding yours from us </s>
<s> as a fair exchange  i speak as to my children  open wide your hearts also </s>
<s> do not be yoked together with unbelievers  for what do righteousness and wickedness have in common  or what fellowship can light have with darkness </s>
<s> what harmony is there between christ and belial  or what does a believer have in common with an unbeliever </s>
<s> what agreement is there between the temple of god and idols  for we are the temple of the living god  as god has said   i will live with them and walk among them  and i will be their god  and they will be my people    come out from them and be separate  touch no unclean thing  and i will receive you    i will be a father to you  and you will be my sons and daughters </s>
<s> therefore  since we have these promises  dear friends  let us purify ourselves from everything that contaminates body and spirit  perfecting holiness out of reverence for god </s>
<s> make room for us in your hearts  we have wronged no one  we have corrupted no one  we have exploited no one </s>
<s> i do not say this to condemn you  i have said before that you have such a place in our hearts that we would live or die with you </s>
<s> i have spoken to you with great frankness  i take great pride in you  i am greatly encouraged  in all our troubles my joy knows no bounds </s>
<s> for when we came into macedonia  we had no rest  but we were harassed at every turn  conflicts on the outside  fears within </s>
<s> but god  who comforts the downcast  comforted us by the coming of titus </s>
<s> and not only by his coming but also by the comfort you had given him  he told us about your longing for me  your deep sorrow  your ardent concern for me  so that my joy was greater than ever </s>
<s> even if i caused you sorrow by my letter  i do not regret it  though i did regret it  i see that my letter hurt you  but only for a little while </s>
<s> yet now i am happy  not because you were made sorry  but because your sorrow led you to repentance  for you became sorrowful as god intended and so were not harmed in any way by us </s>
<s> godly sorrow brings repentance that leads to salvation and leaves no regret  but worldly sorrow brings death </s>
<s> see what this godly sorrow has produced in you  what earnestness  what eagerness to clear yourselves  what indignation  what alarm  what longing  what concern  what readiness to see justice done  at every point you have proved yourselves to be innocent in this matter </s>
<s> so even though i wrote to you  it was neither on account of the one who did the wrong nor on account of the injured party  but rather that before god you could see for yourselves how devoted to us you are </s>
<s> by all this we are encouraged  in addition to our own encouragement  we were especially delighted to see how happy titus was  because his spirit has been refreshed by all of you </s>
<s> i had boasted to him about you  and you have not embarrassed me  but just as everything we said to you was true  so our boasting about you to titus has proved to be true as well </s>
<s> and his affection for you is all the greater when he remembers that you were all obedient  receiving him with fear and trembling </s>
<s> i am glad i can have complete confidence in you </s>
<s> and now  brothers and sisters  we want you to know about the grace that god has given the macedonian churches </s>
<s> in the midst of a very severe trial  their overflowing joy and their extreme poverty welled up in rich generosity </s>
<s> for i testify that they gave as much as they were able  and even beyond their ability  entirely on their own </s>
<s> they urgently pleaded with us for the privilege of sharing in this service to the lords people </s>
<s> and they exceeded our expectations  they gave themselves first of all to the lord  and then by the will of god also to us </s>
<s> so we urged titus  just as he had earlier made a beginning  to bring also to completion this act of grace on your part </s>
<s> but since you excel in everything  in faith  in speech  in knowledge  in complete earnestness and in the love we have kindled in you  see that you also excel in this grace of giving </s>
<s> i am not commanding you  but i want to test the sincerity of your love by comparing it with the earnestness of others </s>
<s> for you know the grace of our lord jesus christ  that though he was rich  yet for your sake he became poor  so that you through his poverty might become rich </s>
<s> and here is my judgment about what is best for you in this matter  last year you were the first not only to give but also to have the desire to do so </s>
<s> now finish the work  so that your eager willingness to do it may be matched by your completion of it  according to your means </s>
<s> for if the willingness is there  the gift is acceptable according to what one has  not according to what one does not have </s>
<s> our desire is not that others might be relieved while you are hard pressed  but that there might be equality </s>
<s> at the present time your plenty will supply what they need  so that in turn their plenty will supply what you need  the goal is equality </s>
<s> as it is written   the one who gathered much did not have too much  and the one who gathered little did not have too little  </s>
<s> thanks be to god  who put into the heart of titus the same concern i have for you </s>
<s> for titus not only welcomed our appeal  but he is coming to you with much enthusiasm and on his own initiative </s>
<s> and we are sending along with him the brother who is praised by all the churches for his service to the gospel </s>
<s> what is more  he was chosen by the churches to accompany us as we carry the offering  which we administer in order to honour the lord himself and to show our eagerness to help </s>
<s> we want to avoid any criticism of the way we administer this liberal gift </s>
<s> for we are taking pains to do what is right  not only in the eyes of the lord but also in the eyes of man </s>
<s> in addition  we are sending with them our brother who has often proved to us in many ways that he is zealous  and now even more so because of his great confidence in you </s>
<s> as for titus  he is my partner and fellow worker among you  as for our brothers  they are representatives of the churches and an honour to christ </s>
<s> therefore show these men the proof of your love and the reason for our pride in you  so that the churches can see it </s>
<s> there is no need for me to write to you about this service to the lords people </s>
<s> for i know your eagerness to help  and i have been boasting about it to the macedonians  telling them that since last year you in achaia were ready to give  and your enthusiasm has stirred most of them to action </s>
<s> but i am sending the brothers in order that our boasting about you in this matter should not prove hollow  but that you may be ready  as i said you would be </s>
<s> for if any macedonians come with me and find you unprepared  we  not to say anything about you  would be ashamed of having been so confident </s>
<s> so i thought it necessary to urge the brothers to visit you in advance and finish the arrangements for the generous gift you had promised  then it will be ready as a generous gift  not as one grudgingly given </s>
<s> remember this  whoever sows sparingly will also reap sparingly  and whoever sows generously will also reap generously </s>
<s> each of you should give what you have decided in your heart to give  not reluctantly or under compulsion  for god loves a cheerful giver </s>
<s> and god is able to bless you abundantly  so that in all things at all times  having all that you need  you will abound in every good work </s>
<s> as it is written   they have freely scattered their gifts to the poor  their righteousness endures for ever  </s>
<s> this service that you perform is not only supplying the needs of the lords people but is also overflowing in many expressions of thanks to god </s>
<s> because of the service by which you have proved yourselves  others will praise god for the obedience that accompanies your confession of the gospel of christ  and for your generosity in sharing with them and with everyone else </s>
<s> and in their prayers for you their hearts will go out to you  because of the surpassing grace god has given you </s>
<s> thanks be to god for his indescribable gift </s>
<s> by the humility and gentleness of christ  i appeal to you  i  paul  who am  timid when face to face with you  but  bold towards you when away </s>
<s> i beg you that when i come i may not have to be as bold as i expect to be towards some people who think that we live by the standards of this world </s>
<s> for though we live in the world  we do not wage war as the world does </s>
<s> the weapons we fight with are not the weapons of the world  on the contrary  they have divine power to demolish strongholds </s>
<s> we demolish arguments and every pretension that sets itself up against the knowledge of god  and we take captive every thought to make it obedient to christ </s>
<s> and we will be ready to punish every act of disobedience  once your obedience is complete </s>
<s> you are judging by appearances  if anyone is confident that they belong to christ  they should consider again that we belong to christ just as much as they do </s>
<s> so even if i boast somewhat freely about the authority the lord gave us for building you up rather than tearing you down  i will not be ashamed of it </s>
<s> i do not want to seem to be trying to frighten you with my letters </s>
<s> for some say   his letters are weighty and forceful  but in person he is unimpressive and his speaking amounts to nothing  </s>
<s> such people should realise that what we are in our letters when we are absent  we will be in our actions when we are present </s>
<s> we do not dare to classify or compare ourselves with some who commend themselves  when they measure themselves by themselves and compare themselves with themselves  they are not wise </s>
<s> we  however  will not boast beyond proper limits  but will confine our boasting to the sphere of service god himself has assigned to us  a sphere that also includes you </s>
<s> we are not going too far in our boasting  as would be the case if we had not come to you  for we did get as far as you with the gospel of christ </s>
<s> neither do we go beyond our limits by boasting of work done by others  our hope is that  as your faith continues to grow  our sphere of activity among you will greatly expand </s>
<s> so that we can preach the gospel in the regions beyond you  for we do not want to boast about work already done in someone elses territory </s>
<s> but   let the one who boasts boast in the lord  </s>
<s> for it is not the one who commends himself who is approved  but the one whom the lord commends </s>
<s> i hope you will put up with me in a little foolishness  yes  please put up with me </s>
<s> i am jealous for you with a godly jealousy  i promised you to one husband  to christ  so that i might present you as a pure virgin to him </s>
<s> but i am afraid that just as eve was deceived by the snakes cunning  your minds may somehow be led astray from your sincere and pure devotion to christ </s>
<s> for if someone comes to you and preaches a jesus other than the jesus we preached  or if you receive a different spirit from the spirit you received  or a different gospel from the one you accepted  you put up with it easily enough </s>
<s> i do not think i am in the least inferior to those  superapostles </s>
<s> i may indeed be untrained as a speaker  but i do have knowledge  we have made this perfectly clear to you in every way </s>
<s> was it a sin for me to lower myself in order to elevate you by preaching the gospel of god to you free of charge </s>
<s> i robbed other churches by receiving support from them so as to serve you </s>
<s> and when i was with you and needed something  i was not a burden to anyone  for the brothers who came from macedonia supplied what i needed  i have kept myself from being a burden to you in any way  and will continue to do so </s>
<s> as surely as the truth of christ is in me  nobody in the regions of achaia will stop this boasting of mine </s>
<s> why  because i do not love you  god knows i do </s>
<s> and i will keep on doing what i am doing in order to cut the ground from under those who want an opportunity to be considered equal with us in the things they boast about </s>
<s> for such people are false apostles  deceitful workers  masquerading as apostles of christ </s>
<s> and no wonder  for satan himself masquerades as an angel of light </s>
<s> it is not surprising  then  if his servants also masquerade as servants of righteousness  their end will be what their actions deserve </s>
<s> i repeat  let no one take me for a fool  but if you do  then tolerate me just as you would a fool  so that i may do a little boasting </s>
<s> in this selfconfident boasting i am not talking as the lord would  but as a fool </s>
<s> since many are boasting in the way the world does  i too will boast </s>
<s> you gladly put up with fools since you are so wise </s>
<s> in fact  you even put up with anyone who enslaves you or exploits you or takes advantage of you or puts on airs or slaps you in the face </s>
<s> to my shame i admit that we were too weak for that  whatever anyone else dares to boast about  i am speaking as a fool  i also dare to boast about </s>
<s> are they hebrews  so am i  are they israelites  so am i  are they abrahams descendants  so am i </s>
<s> are they servants of christ   i am out of my mind to talk like this   i am more  i have worked much harder  been in prison more frequently  been flogged more severely  and been exposed to death again and again </s>
<s> five times i received from the jews the forty lashes minus one </s>
<s> three times i was beaten with rods  once i was pelted with stones  three times i was shipwrecked  i spent a night and a day in the open sea </s>
<s> i have been constantly on the move  i have been in danger from rivers  in danger from bandits  in danger from my fellow jews  in danger from gentiles  in danger in the city  in danger in the country  in danger at sea  and in danger from false believers </s>
<s> i have laboured and toiled and have often gone without sleep  i have known hunger and thirst and have often gone without food  i have been cold and naked </s>
<s> besides everything else  i face daily the pressure of my concern for all the churches </s>
<s> who is weak  and i do not feel weak  who is led into sin  and i do not inwardly burn </s>
<s> if i must boast  i will boast of the things that show my weakness </s>
<s> the god and father of the lord jesus  who is to be praised for ever  knows that i am not lying </s>
<s> in damascus the governor under king aretas had the city of the damascenes guarded in order to arrest me </s>
<s> but i was lowered in a basket from a window in the wall and slipped through his hands </s>
<s> i must go on boasting  although there is nothing to be gained  i will go on to visions and revelations from the lord </s>
<s> i know a man in christ who fourteen years ago was caught up to the third heaven  whether it was in the body or out of the body i do not know  god knows </s>
<s> and i know that this man  whether in the body or apart from the body i do not know  but god knows </s>
<s> was caught up to paradise and heard inexpressible things  things that no one is permitted to tell </s>
<s> i will boast about a man like that  but i will not boast about myself  except about my weaknesses </s>
<s> even if i should choose to boast  i would not be a fool  because i would be speaking the truth  but i refrain  so no one will think more of me than is warranted by what i do or say </s>
<s> or because of these surpassingly great revelations  therefore  in order to keep me from becoming conceited  i was given a thorn in my flesh  a messenger of satan  to torment me </s>
<s> three times i pleaded with the lord to take it away from me </s>
<s> but he said to me   my grace is sufficient for you  for my power is made perfect in weakness   therefore i will boast all the more gladly about my weaknesses  so that christs power may rest on me </s>
<s> that is why  for christs sake  i delight in weaknesses  in insults  in hardships  in persecutions  in difficulties  for when i am weak  then i am strong </s>
<s> i have made a fool of myself  but you drove me to it  i ought to have been commended by you  for i am not in the least inferior to the  superapostles  even though i am nothing </s>
<s> i persevered in demonstrating among you the marks of a true apostle  including signs  wonders and miracles </s>
<s> how were you inferior to the other churches  except that i was never a burden to you  forgive me this wrong </s>
<s> now i am ready to visit you for the third time  and i will not be a burden to you  because what i want is not your possessions but you  after all  children should not have to save up for their parents  but parents for their children </s>
<s> so i will very gladly spend for you everything i have and expend myself as well  if i love you more  will you love me less </s>
<s> be that as it may  i have not been a burden to you  yet  crafty fellow that i am  i caught you by trickery </s>
<s> did i exploit you through any of the men i sent to you </s>
<s> i urged titus to go to you and i sent our brother with him  titus did not exploit you  did he  did we not walk in the same footsteps by the same spirit </s>
<s> have you been thinking all along that we have been defending ourselves to you  we have been speaking in the sight of god as those in christ  and everything we do  dear friends  is for your strengthening </s>
<s> for i am afraid that when i come i may not find you as i want you to be  and you may not find me as you want me to be  i fear that there may be discord  jealousy  fits of rage  selfish ambition  slander  gossip  arrogance and disorder </s>
<s> i am afraid that when i come again my god will humble me before you  and i will be grieved over many who have sinned earlier and have not repented of the impurity  sexual sin and debauchery in which they have indulged </s>
<s> this will be my third visit to you   every matter must be established by the testimony of two or three witnesses  </s>
<s> i already gave you a warning when i was with you the second time  i now repeat it while absent  on my return i will not spare those who sinned earlier or any of the others </s>
<s> since you are demanding proof that christ is speaking through me  he is not weak in dealing with you  but is powerful among you </s>
<s> for to be sure  he was crucified in weakness  yet he lives by gods power  likewise  we are weak in him  yet by gods power we will live with him in our dealing with you </s>
<s> examine yourselves to see whether you are in the faith  test yourselves  do you not realise that christ jesus is in you  unless  of course  you fail the test </s>
<s> and i trust that you will discover that we have not failed the test </s>
<s> now we pray to god that you will not do anything wrong  not so that people will see that we have stood the test but so that you will do what is right even though we may seem to have failed </s>
<s> for we cannot do anything against the truth  but only for the truth </s>
<s> we are glad whenever we are weak but you are strong  and our prayer is that you may be fully restored </s>
<s> this is why i write these things when i am absent  that when i come i may not have to be harsh in my use of authority  the authority the lord gave me for building you up  not for tearing you down </s>
<s> finally  brothers and sisters  rejoice  strive for full restoration  encourage one another  be of one mind  live in peace  and the god of love and peace will be with you </s>
<s> greet one another with a holy kiss </s>
<s> all gods people here send their greetings </s>
<s> may the grace of the lord jesus christ  and the love of god  and the fellowship of the holy spirit be with you all </s>
<s> paul  an apostle  sent not from men nor by a man  but by jesus christ and god the father  who raised him from the dead </s>
<s> and all the brothers and sisters with me  to the churches in galatia </s>
<s> grace and peace to you from god our father and the lord jesus christ </s>
<s> who gave himself for our sins to rescue us from the present evil age  according to the will of our god and father </s>
<s> to whom be glory for ever and ever  amen </s>
<s> i am astonished that you are so quickly deserting the one who called you to live in the grace of christ and are turning to a different gospel </s>
<s> which is really no gospel at all  evidently some people are throwing you into confusion and are trying to pervert the gospel of christ </s>
<s> but even if we or an angel from heaven should preach a gospel other than the one we preached to you  let them be under gods curse </s>
<s> as we have already said  so now i say again  if anybody is preaching to you a gospel other than what you accepted  let them be under gods curse </s>
<s> am i now trying to win the approval of human beings  or of god  or am i trying to please people  if i were still trying to please people  i would not be a servant of christ </s>
<s> i want you to know  brothers and sisters  that the gospel i preached is not of human origin </s>
<s> i did not receive it from any man  nor was i taught it  rather  i received it by revelation from jesus christ </s>
<s> for you have heard of my previous way of life in judaism  how intensely i persecuted the church of god and tried to destroy it </s>
<s> i was advancing in judaism beyond many of my own age among my people and was extremely zealous for the traditions of my fathers </s>
<s> but when god  who set me apart from my mothers womb and called me by his grace  was pleased</s>
<s> to reveal his son in me so that i might preach him among the gentiles  my immediate response was not to consult any human being </s>
<s> i did not go up to jerusalem to see those who were apostles before i was  but i went into arabia  later i returned to damascus </s>
<s> then after three years  i went up to jerusalem to get acquainted with cephas and stayed with him fifteen days </s>
<s> i saw none of the other apostles  only james  the lords brother </s>
<s> i assure you before god that what i am writing to you is no lie </s>
<s> then i went to syria and cilicia </s>
<s> i was personally unknown to the churches of judea that are in christ </s>
<s> they only heard the report   the man who formerly persecuted us is now preaching the faith he once tried to destroy  </s>
<s> and they praised god because of me </s>
<s> then after fourteen years  i went up again to jerusalem  this time with barnabas  i took titus along also </s>
<s> i went in response to a revelation and  meeting privately with those esteemed as leaders  i presented to them the gospel that i preach among the gentiles  i wanted to be sure i was not running and had not been running my race in vain </s>
<s> yet not even titus  who was with me  was compelled to be circumcised  even though he was a greek </s>
<s> this matter arose because some false believers had infiltrated our ranks to spy on the freedom we have in christ jesus and to make us slaves </s>
<s> we did not give in to them for a moment  so that the truth of the gospel might be preserved for you </s>
<s> as for those who were held in high esteem  whatever they were makes no difference to me  god does not show favouritism  they added nothing to my message </s>
<s> on the contrary  they recognised that i had been entrusted with the task of preaching the gospel to the uncircumcised  just as peter had been to the circumcised </s>
<s> for god  who was at work in peter as an apostle to the circumcised  was also at work in me as an apostle to the gentiles </s>
<s> james  cephas and john  those esteemed as pillars  gave me and barnabas the right hand of fellowship when they recognised the grace given to me  they agreed that we should go to the gentiles  and they to the circumcised </s>
<s> all they asked was that we should continue to remember the poor  the very thing i had been eager to do all along </s>
<s> when cephas came to antioch  i opposed him to his face  because he stood condemned </s>
<s> for before certain men came from james  he used to eat with the gentiles  but when they arrived  he began to draw back and separate himself from the gentiles because he was afraid of those who belonged to the circumcision group </s>
<s> the other jews joined him in his hypocrisy  so that by their hypocrisy even barnabas was led astray </s>
<s> when i saw that they were not acting in line with the truth of the gospel  i said to cephas in front of them all   you are a jew  yet you live like a gentile and not like a jew  how is it  then  that you force gentiles to follow jewish customs </s>
<s>  we who are jews by birth and not sinful gentiles</s>
<s> know that a person is not justified by the works of the law  but by faith in jesus christ  so we  too  have put our faith in christ jesus that we may be justified by faith in christ and not by the works of the law  because by the works of the law no one will be justified </s>
<s>  but if  in seeking to be justified in christ  we jews find ourselves also among the sinners  doesnt that mean that christ promotes sin  absolutely not </s>
<s> if i rebuild what i destroyed  then i really would be a lawbreaker </s>
<s>  for through the law i died to the law so that i might live for god </s>
<s> i have been crucified with christ and i no longer live  but christ lives in me  the life i now live in the body  i live by faith in the son of god  who loved me and gave himself for me </s>
<s> i do not set aside the grace of god  for if righteousness could be gained through the law  christ died for nothing  </s>
<s> you foolish galatians  who has bewitched you  before your very eyes jesus christ was clearly portrayed as crucified </s>
<s> i would like to learn just one thing from you  did you receive the spirit by the works of the law  or by believing what you heard </s>
<s> are you so foolish  after beginning by means of the spirit  are you now trying to finish by means of the flesh </s>
<s> have you experienced so much in vain  if it really was in vain </s>
<s> so again i ask  does god give you his spirit and work miracles among you by the works of the law  or by your believing what you heard </s>
<s> so also abraham  believed god  and it was credited to him as righteousness  </s>
<s> understand  then  that those who have faith are children of abraham </s>
<s> scripture foresaw that god would justify the gentiles by faith  and announced the gospel in advance to abraham   all nations will be blessed through you  </s>
<s> so those who rely on faith are blessed along with abraham  the man of faith </s>
<s> for all who rely on the works of the law are under a curse  as it is written   cursed is everyone who does not continue to do everything written in the book of the law  </s>
<s> clearly no one who relies on the law is justified before god  because  the righteous will live by faith  </s>
<s> the law is not based on faith  on the contrary  it says   the person who does these things will live by them  </s>
<s> christ redeemed us from the curse of the law by becoming a curse for us  for it is written   cursed is everyone who is hung on a pole  </s>
<s> he redeemed us in order that the blessing given to abraham might come to the gentiles through christ jesus  so that by faith we might receive the promise of the spirit </s>
<s> brothers and sisters  let me take an example from everyday life  just as no one can set aside or add to a human covenant that has been duly established  so it is in this case </s>
<s> the promises were spoken to abraham and to his seed  scripture does not say  and to seeds  meaning many people  but  and to your seed  meaning one person  who is christ </s>
<s> what i mean is this  the law  introduced 430 years later  does not set aside the covenant previously established by god and thus do away with the promise </s>
<s> for if the inheritance depends on the law  then it no longer depends on the promise  but god in his grace gave it to abraham through a promise </s>
<s> why  then  was the law given at all  it was added because of transgressions until the seed to whom the promise referred had come  the law was given through angels and entrusted to a mediator </s>
<s> a mediator  however  implies more than one party  but god is one </s>
<s> is the law  therefore  opposed to the promises of god  absolutely not  for if a law had been given that could impart life  then righteousness would certainly have come by the law </s>
<s> but scripture has locked up everything under the control of sin  so that what was promised  being given through faith in jesus christ  might be given to those who believe </s>
<s> before the coming of this faith  we were held in custody under the law  locked up until the faith that was to come would be revealed </s>
<s> so the law was our guardian until christ came that we might be justified by faith </s>
<s> now that this faith has come  we are no longer under a guardian </s>
<s> so in christ jesus you are all children of god through faith </s>
<s> for all of you who were baptised into christ have clothed yourselves with christ </s>
<s> there is neither jew nor gentile  neither slave nor free  nor is there male and female  for you are all one in christ jesus </s>
<s> if you belong to christ  then you are abrahams seed  and heirs according to the promise </s>
<s> what i am saying is that as long as an heir is under age  he is no different from a slave  although he owns the whole estate </s>
<s> the heir is subject to guardians and trustees until the time set by his father </s>
<s> so also  when we were under age  we were in slavery under the elemental spiritual forces of the world </s>
<s> but when the set time had fully come  god sent his son  born of a woman  born under the law </s>
<s> to redeem those under the law  that we might receive adoption to sonship </s>
<s> because you are his sons  god sent the spirit of his son into our hearts  the spirit who calls out   abba  father  </s>
<s> so you are no longer a slave  but gods child  and since you are his child  god has made you also an heir </s>
<s> formerly  when you did not know god  you were slaves to those who by nature are not gods </s>
<s> but now that you know god  or rather are known by god  how is it that you are turning back to those weak and miserable forces  do you wish to be enslaved by them all over again </s>
<s> you are observing special days and months and seasons and years </s>
<s> i fear for you  that somehow i have wasted my efforts on you </s>
<s> i plead with you  brothers and sisters  become like me  for i became like you  you did me no wrong </s>
<s> as you know  it was because of an illness that i first preached the gospel to you </s>
<s> and even though my illness was a trial to you  you did not treat me with contempt or scorn  instead  you welcomed me as if i were an angel of god  as if i were christ jesus himself </s>
<s> where  then  is your blessing of me now  i can testify that  if you could have done so  you would have torn out your eyes and given them to me </s>
<s> have i now become your enemy by telling you the truth </s>
<s> those people are zealous to win you over  but for no good  what they want is to alienate you from us  so that you may have zeal for them </s>
<s> it is fine to be zealous  provided the purpose is good  and to be so always  not just when i am with you </s>
<s> my dear children  for whom i am again in the pains of childbirth until christ is formed in you </s>
<s> how i wish i could be with you now and change my tone  because i am perplexed about you </s>
<s> tell me  you who want to be under the law  are you not aware of what the law says </s>
<s> for it is written that abraham had two sons  one by the slave woman and the other by the free woman </s>
<s> his son by the slave woman was born according to the flesh  but his son by the free woman was born as the result of a divine promise </s>
<s> these things are being taken figuratively  the women represent two covenants  one covenant is from mount sinai and bears children who are to be slaves  this is hagar </s>
<s> now hagar stands for mount sinai in arabia and corresponds to the present city of jerusalem  because she is in slavery with her children </s>
<s> but the jerusalem that is above is free  and she is our mother </s>
<s> for it is written   be glad  barren woman  you who never bore a child  break forth and cry aloud  you who were never in labour  because more are the children of the desolate woman than of her who has a husband  </s>
<s> now you  brothers and sisters  like isaac  are children of promise </s>
<s> at that time the son born according to the flesh persecuted the son born by the power of the spirit  it is the same now </s>
<s> but what does scripture say   get rid of the slave woman and her son  for the slave womans son will never share in the inheritance with the free womans son  </s>
<s> therefore  brothers and sisters  we are not children of the slave woman  but of the free woman </s>
<s> it is for freedom that christ has set us free  stand firm  then  and do not let yourselves be burdened again by a yoke of slavery </s>
<s> mark my words  i  paul  tell you that if you let yourselves be circumcised  christ will be of no value to you at all </s>
<s> again i declare to every man who lets himself be circumcised that he is required to obey the whole law </s>
<s> you who are trying to be justified by the law have been alienated from christ  you have fallen away from grace </s>
<s> for through the spirit we eagerly await by faith the righteousness for which we hope </s>
<s> for in christ jesus neither circumcision nor uncircumcision has any value  the only thing that counts is faith expressing itself through love </s>
<s> you were running a good race  who cut in on you to keep you from obeying the truth </s>
<s> that kind of persuasion does not come from the one who calls you </s>
<s>  a little yeast works through the whole batch of dough  </s>
<s> i am confident in the lord that you will take no other view  the one who is throwing you into confusion  whoever that may be  will have to pay the penalty </s>
<s> brothers and sisters  if i am still preaching circumcision  why am i still being persecuted  in that case the offence of the cross has been abolished </s>
<s> as for those agitators  i wish they would go the whole way and emasculate themselves </s>
<s> you  my brothers and sisters  were called to be free  but do not use your freedom to indulge the flesh  rather  serve one another humbly in love </s>
<s> for the entire law is fulfilled in keeping this one command   love your neighbour as yourself  </s>
<s> if you bite and devour each other  watch out or you will be destroyed by each other </s>
<s> so i say  live by the spirit  and you will not gratify the desires of the flesh </s>
<s> for the flesh desires what is contrary to the spirit  and the spirit what is contrary to the flesh  they are in conflict with each other  so that you are not to do whatever you want </s>
<s> but if you are led by the spirit  you are not under the law </s>
<s> the acts of the flesh are obvious  sexual immorality  impurity and debauchery </s>
<s> idolatry and witchcraft  hatred  discord  jealousy  fits of rage  selfish ambition  dissensions  factions</s>
<s> and envy  drunkenness  orgies  and the like  i warn you  as i did before  that those who live like this will not inherit the kingdom of god </s>
<s> but the fruit of the spirit is love  joy  peace  forbearance  kindness  goodness  faithfulness </s>
<s> gentleness and selfcontrol  against such things there is no law </s>
<s> those who belong to christ jesus have crucified the flesh with its passions and desires </s>
<s> since we live by the spirit  let us keep in step with the spirit </s>
<s> let us not become conceited  provoking and envying each other </s>
<s> brothers and sisters  if someone is caught in a sin  you who live by the spirit should restore that person gently  but watch yourselves  or you also may be tempted </s>
<s> carry each others burdens  and in this way you will fulfil the law of christ </s>
<s> if anyone thinks they are something when they are not  they deceive themselves </s>
<s> each one should test their own actions  then they can take pride in themselves alone  without comparing themselves to someone else </s>
<s> for each one should carry their own load </s>
<s> nevertheless  the one who receives instruction in the word should share all good things with their instructor </s>
<s> do not be deceived  god cannot be mocked  a man reaps what he sows </s>
<s> whoever sows to please their flesh  from the flesh will reap destruction  whoever sows to please the spirit  from the spirit will reap eternal life </s>
<s> let us not become weary in doing good  for at the proper time we will reap a harvest if we do not give up </s>
<s> therefore  as we have opportunity  let us do good to all people  especially to those who belong to the family of believers </s>
<s> see what large letters i use as i write to you with my own hand </s>
<s> those who want to impress people by means of the flesh are trying to compel you to be circumcised  the only reason they do this is to avoid being persecuted for the cross of christ </s>
<s> not even those who are circumcised keep the law  yet they want you to be circumcised that they may boast about your circumcision in the flesh </s>
<s> may i never boast except in the cross of our lord jesus christ  through which the world has been crucified to me  and i to the world </s>
<s> neither circumcision nor uncircumcision means anything  what counts is the new creation </s>
<s> peace and mercy to all who follow this rule  to the israel of god </s>
<s> from now on  let no one cause me trouble  for i bear on my body the marks of jesus </s>
<s> the grace of our lord jesus christ be with your spirit  brothers and sisters  amen </s>

<s> praise be to the god and father of our lord jesus christ  who has blessed us in the heavenly realms with every spiritual blessing in christ </s>

<s> he predestined us for adoption to sonship through jesus christ  in accordance with his pleasure and will </s>
<s> to the praise of his glorious grace  which he has freely given us in the one he loves </s>
<s> in him we have redemption through his blood  the forgiveness of sins  in accordance with the riches of gods grace</s>
<s> that he lavished on us  with all wisdom and understanding </s>
<s> he made known to us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure  which he purposed in christ </s>
<s> to be put into effect when the times reach their fulfilment  to bring unity to all things in heaven and on earth under christ </s>
<s> in him we were also chosen  having been predestined according to the plan of him who works out everything in conformity with the purpose of his will </s>
<s> in order that we  who were the first to put our hope in christ  might be for the praise of his glory </s>
<s> and you also were included in christ when you heard the message of truth  the gospel of your salvation  when you believed  you were marked in him with a seal  the promised holy spirit </s>
<s> who is a deposit guaranteeing our inheritance until the redemption of those who are gods possession  to the praise of his glory </s>
<s> for this reason  ever since i heard about your faith in the lord jesus and your love for all gods people </s>
<s> i have not stopped giving thanks for you  remembering you in my prayers </s>
<s> i keep asking that the god of our lord jesus christ  the glorious father  may give you the spirit of wisdom and revelation  so that you may know him better </s>
<s> i pray that the eyes of your heart may be enlightened in order that you may know the hope to which he has called you  the riches of his glorious inheritance in his holy people </s>
<s> and his incomparably great power for us who believe  that power is the same as the mighty strength</s>
<s> he exerted when he raised christ from the dead and seated him at his right hand in the heavenly realms </s>
<s> far above all rule and authority  power and dominion  and every name that is invoked  not only in the present age but also in the one to come </s>
<s> and god placed all things under his feet and appointed him to be head over everything for the church </s>
<s> which is his body  the fullness of him who fills everything in every way </s>
<s> as for you  you were dead in your transgressions and sins </s>
<s> in which you used to live when you followed the ways of this world and of the ruler of the kingdom of the air  the spirit who is now at work in those who are disobedient </s>
<s> all of us also lived among them at one time  gratifying the cravings of our flesh and following its desires and thoughts  like the rest  we were by nature deserving of wrath </s>
<s> but because of his great love for us  god  who is rich in mercy </s>
<s> made us alive with christ even when we were dead in transgressions  it is by grace you have been saved </s>
<s> and god raised us up with christ and seated us with him in the heavenly realms in christ jesus </s>
<s> in order that in the coming ages he might show the incomparable riches of his grace  expressed in his kindness to us in christ jesus </s>
<s> for it is by grace you have been saved  through faith  and this is not from yourselves  it is the gift of god </s>
<s> not by works  so that no one can boast </s>
<s> for we are gods handiwork  created in christ jesus to do good works  which god prepared in advance for us to do </s>
<s> therefore  remember that formerly you who are gentiles by birth and called  uncircumcised by those who call themselves  the circumcision  which is done in the body by human hands  </s>
<s> remember that at that time you were separate from christ  excluded from citizenship in israel and foreigners to the covenants of the promise  without hope and without god in the world </s>
<s> but now in christ jesus you who once were far away have been brought near by the blood of christ </s>
<s> for he himself is our peace  who has made the two groups one and has destroyed the barrier  the dividing wall of hostility </s>
<s> by setting aside in his flesh the law with its commands and regulations  his purpose was to create in himself one new humanity out of the two  thus making peace </s>
<s> and in one body to reconcile both of them to god through the cross  by which he put to death their hostility </s>
<s> he came and preached peace to you who were far away and peace to those who were near </s>
<s> for through him we both have access to the father by one spirit </s>
<s> consequently  you are no longer foreigners and strangers  but fellow citizens with gods people and also members of his household </s>
<s> built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets  with christ jesus himself as the chief cornerstone </s>
<s> in him the whole building is joined together and rises to become a holy temple in the lord </s>
<s> and in him you too are being built together to become a dwelling in which god lives by his spirit </s>
<s> for this reason i  paul  the prisoner of christ jesus for the sake of you gentiles </s>
<s> surely you have heard about the administration of gods grace that was given to me for you </s>
<s> that is  the mystery made known to me by revelation  as i have already written briefly </s>
<s> in reading this  then  you will be able to understand my insight into the mystery of christ </s>
<s> which was not made known to people in other generations as it has now been revealed by the spirit to gods holy apostles and prophets </s>
<s> this mystery is that through the gospel the gentiles are heirs together with israel  members together of one body  and sharers together in the promise in christ jesus </s>
<s> i became a servant of this gospel by the gift of gods grace given me through the working of his power </s>
<s> although i am less than the least of all the lords people  this grace was given me  to preach to the gentiles the boundless riches of christ </s>
<s> and to make plain to everyone the administration of this mystery  which for ages past was kept hidden in god  who created all things </s>
<s> his intent was that now  through the church  the manifold wisdom of god should be made known to the rulers and authorities in the heavenly realms </s>
<s> according to his eternal purpose that he accomplished in christ jesus our lord </s>
<s> in him and through faith in him we may approach god with freedom and confidence </s>
<s> i ask you  therefore  not to be discouraged because of my sufferings for you  which are your glory </s>
<s> for this reason i kneel before the father </s>
<s> from whom every family in heaven and on earth derives its name </s>
<s> i pray that out of his glorious riches he may strengthen you with power through his spirit in your inner being </s>
<s> so that christ may dwell in your hearts through faith  and i pray that you  being rooted and established in love </s>
<s> may have power  together with all the lords holy people  to grasp how wide and long and high and deep is the love of christ </s>
<s> and to know this love that surpasses knowledge  that you may be filled to the measure of all the fulness of god </s>
<s> now to him who is able to do immeasurably more than all we ask or imagine  according to his power that is at work within us </s>
<s> to him be glory in the church and in christ jesus throughout all generations  for ever and ever  amen </s>
<s> as a prisoner for the lord  then  i urge you to live a life worthy of the calling you have received </s>
<s> be completely humble and gentle  be patient  bearing with one another in love </s>
<s> make every effort to keep the unity of the spirit through the bond of peace </s>
<s> there is one body and one spirit  just as you were called to one hope when you were called </s>
<s> one lord  one faith  one baptism </s>
<s> one god and father of all  who is over all and through all and in all </s>
<s> but to each one of us grace has been given as christ apportioned it </s>
<s> this is why it says   when he ascended on high  he took many captives and gave gifts to his people  </s>
<s> then we will no longer be infants  tossed back and forth by the waves  and blown here and there by every wind of teaching and by the cunning and craftiness of people in their deceitful scheming </s>
<s> instead  speaking the truth in love  we will grow to become in every respect the mature body of him who is the head  that is  christ </s>
<s> from him the whole body  joined and held together by every supporting ligament  grows and builds itself up in love  as each part does its work </s>
<s> so i tell you this  and insist on it in the lord  that you must no longer live as the gentiles do  in the futility of their thinking </s>
<s> they are darkened in their understanding and separated from the life of god because of the ignorance that is in them due to the hardening of their hearts </s>
<s> having lost all sensitivity  they have given themselves over to sensuality so as to indulge in every kind of impurity  and they are full of greed </s>
<s> that  however  is not the way of life you learned</s>
<s> when you heard about christ and were taught in him in accordance with the truth that is in jesus </s>
<s> you were taught  with regard to your former way of life  to put off your old self  which is being corrupted by its deceitful desires </s>
<s> to be made new in the attitude of your minds </s>
<s> and to put on the new self  created to be like god in true righteousness and holiness </s>
<s> therefore each of you must put off falsehood and speak truthfully to your neighbour  for we are all members of one body </s>
<s>  in your anger do not sin  do not let the sun go down while you are still angry </s>
<s> and do not give the devil a foothold </s>
<s> anyone who has been stealing must steal no longer  but must work  doing something useful with their own hands  that they may have something to share with those in need </s>
<s> do not let any unwholesome talk come out of your mouths  but only what is helpful for building others up according to their needs  that it may benefit those who listen </s>
<s> and do not grieve the holy spirit of god  with whom you were sealed for the day of redemption </s>
<s> get rid of all bitterness  rage and anger  brawling and slander  along with every form of malice </s>
<s> be kind and compassionate to one another  forgiving each other  just as in christ god forgave you </s>
<s> follow gods example  therefore  as dearly loved children</s>
<s> and live a life of love  just as christ loved us and gave himself up for us as a fragrant offering and sacrifice to god </s>
<s> but among you there must not be even a hint of sexual immorality  or of any kind of impurity  or of greed  because these are improper for gods holy people </s>
<s> nor should there be obscenity  foolish talk or coarse joking  which are out of place  but rather thanksgiving </s>
<s> for of this you can be sure  no immoral  impure or greedy person  such a person is an idolater  has any inheritance in the kingdom of christ and of god </s>
<s> let no one deceive you with empty words  for because of such things gods wrath comes on those who are disobedient </s>
<s> therefore do not be partners with them </s>
<s> for you were once darkness  but now you are light in the lord  live as children of light</s>
<s>  for the fruit of the light consists in all goodness  righteousness and truth </s>
<s> and find out what pleases the lord </s>
<s> have nothing to do with the fruitless deeds of darkness  but rather expose them </s>
<s> it is shameful even to mention what the disobedient do in secret </s>
<s> but everything exposed by the light becomes visible  and everything that is illuminated becomes a light </s>
<s> this is why it is said   wake up  sleeper  rise from the dead  and christ will shine on you  </s>
<s> be very careful  then  how you live  not as unwise but as wise </s>
<s> making the most of every opportunity  because the days are evil </s>
<s> therefore do not be foolish  but understand what the lords will is </s>
<s> do not get drunk on wine  which leads to debauchery  instead  be filled with the spirit </s>
<s> speaking to one another with psalms  hymns  and songs from the spirit  sing and make music from your heart to the lord </s>
<s> always giving thanks to god the father for everything  in the name of our lord jesus christ </s>
<s> submit to one another out of reverence for christ </s>
<s> wives  submit yourselves to your own husbands as you do to the lord </s>
<s> for the husband is the head of the wife as christ is the head of the church  his body  of which he is the saviour </s>
<s> now as the church submits to christ  so also wives should submit to their husbands in everything </s>
<s> husbands  love your wives  just as christ loved the church and gave himself up for her</s>
<s> to make her holy  cleansing her by the washing with water through the word </s>
<s> and to present her to himself as a radiant church  without stain or wrinkle or any other blemish  but holy and blameless </s>
<s> in this same way  husbands ought to love their wives as their own bodies  he who loves his wife loves himself </s>
<s> after all  no one ever hated their own body  but they feed and care for their body  just as christ does the church </s>
<s> for we are members of his body </s>
<s>  for this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife  and the two will become one flesh  </s>
<s> this is a profound mystery  but i am talking about christ and the church </s>
<s> however  each one of you also must love his wife as he loves himself  and the wife must respect her husband </s>
<s> children  obey your parents in the lord  for this is right </s>
<s>  honour your father and mother  which is the first commandment with a promise </s>
<s>  so that it may go well with you and that you may enjoy long life on the earth  </s>
<s> fathers  do not exasperate your children  instead  bring them up in the training and instruction of the lord </s>
<s> slaves  obey your earthly masters with respect and fear  and with sincerity of heart  just as you would obey christ </s>
<s> obey them not only to win their favour when their eye is on you  but as slaves of christ  doing the will of god from your heart </s>
<s> serve wholeheartedly  as if you were serving the lord  not people </s>
<s> because you know that the lord will reward each one for whatever good they do  whether they are slave or free </s>
<s> and masters  treat your slaves in the same way  do not threaten them  since you know that he who is both their master and yours is in heaven  and there is no favouritism with him </s>
<s> finally  be strong in the lord and in his mighty power </s>
<s> put on the full armour of god  so that you can take your stand against the devils schemes </s>
<s> for our struggle is not against flesh and blood  but against the rulers  against the authorities  against the powers of this dark world and against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms </s>
<s> therefore put on the full armour of god  so that when the day of evil comes  you may be able to stand your ground  and after you have done everything  to stand </s>
<s> stand firm then  with the belt of truth buckled round your waist  with the breastplate of righteousness in place </s>
<s> and with your feet fitted with the readiness that comes from the gospel of peace </s>
<s> in addition to all this  take up the shield of faith  with which you can extinguish all the flaming arrows of the evil one </s>
<s> take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the spirit  which is the word of god </s>
<s> and pray in the spirit on all occasions with all kinds of prayers and requests  with this in mind  be alert and always keep on praying for all the lords people </s>
<s> pray also for me  that whenever i speak  words may be given me so that i will fearlessly make known the mystery of the gospel </s>
<s> for which i am an ambassador in chains  pray that i may declare it fearlessly  as i should </s>
<s> tychicus  the dear brother and faithful servant in the lord  will tell you everything  so that you also may know how i am and what i am doing </s>
<s> i am sending him to you for this very purpose  that you may know how we are  and that he may encourage you </s>
<s> peace to the brothers and sisters  and love with faith from god the father and the lord jesus christ </s>
<s> grace to all who love our lord jesus christ with an undying love </s>
<s> paul and timothy  servants of christ jesus  to all gods holy people in christ jesus at philippi  together with the overseers and deacons </s>
<s> grace and peace to you from god our father and the lord jesus christ </s>
<s> i thank my god every time i remember you </s>
<s> in all my prayers for all of you  i always pray with joy</s>
<s> because of your partnership in the gospel from the first day until now </s>
<s> being confident of this  that he who began a good work in you will carry it on to completion until the day of christ jesus </s>
<s> it is right for me to feel this way about all of you  since i have you in my heart and  whether i am in chains or defending and confirming the gospel  all of you share in gods grace with me </s>
<s> god can testify how i long for all of you with the affection of christ jesus </s>
<s> and this is my prayer  that your love may abound more and more in knowledge and depth of insight </s>
<s> so that you may be able to discern what is best and may be pure and blameless for the day of christ </s>
<s> filled with the fruit of righteousness that comes through jesus christ  to the glory and praise of god </s>
<s> now i want you to know  brothers and sisters  that what has happened to me has actually served to advance the gospel </s>
<s> as a result  it has become clear throughout the whole palace guard and to everyone else that i am in chains for christ </s>
<s> and because of my chains  most of the brothers and sisters have become confident in the lord and dare all the more to proclaim the gospel without fear </s>
<s> it is true that some preach christ out of envy and rivalry  but others out of goodwill </s>
<s> the latter do so out of love  knowing that i am put here for the defence of the gospel </s>
<s> the former preach christ out of selfish ambition  not sincerely  supposing that they can stir up trouble for me while i am in chains </s>
<s> but what does it matter  the important thing is that in every way  whether from false motives or true  christ is preached  and because of this i rejoice  yes  and i will continue to rejoice </s>
<s> for i know that through your prayers and gods provision of the spirit of jesus christ what has happened to me will turn out for my deliverance </s>
<s> i eagerly expect and hope that i will in no way be ashamed  but will have sufficient courage so that now as always christ will be exalted in my body  whether by life or by death </s>
<s> for to me  to live is christ and to die is gain </s>
<s> if i am to go on living in the body  this will mean fruitful labour for me  yet what shall i choose  i do not know </s>
<s> i am torn between the two  i desire to depart and be with christ  which is better by far </s>
<s> but it is more necessary for you that i remain in the body </s>
<s> convinced of this  i know that i will remain  and i will continue with all of you for your progress and joy in the faith </s>
<s> so that through my being with you again your boasting in christ jesus will abound on account of me </s>
<s> whatever happens  conduct yourselves in a manner worthy of the gospel of christ  then  whether i come and see you or only hear about you in my absence  i will know that you stand firm in the one spirit  striving together as one for the faith of the gospel</s>
<s> without being frightened in any way by those who oppose you  this is a sign to them that they will be destroyed  but that you will be saved  and that by god </s>
<s> for it has been granted to you on behalf of christ not only to believe in him  but also to suffer for him </s>
<s> since you are going through the same struggle you saw i had  and now hear that i still have </s>
<s> therefore if you have any encouragement from being united with christ  if any comfort from his love  if any common sharing in the spirit  if any tenderness and compassion </s>
<s> then make my joy complete by being likeminded  having the same love  being one in spirit and of one mind </s>
<s> do nothing out of selfish ambition or vain conceit  rather  in humility value others above yourselves </s>
<s> not looking to your own interests but each of you to the interests of the others </s>
<s> in your relationships with one another  have the same mindset as christ jesus </s>
<s> who  being in very nature god  did not consider equality with god something to be used to his own advantage </s>
<s> rather  he made himself nothing by taking the very nature of a servant  being made in human likeness </s>
<s> and being found in appearance as a man  he humbled himself by becoming obedient to death </s>
<s> therefore god exalted him to the highest place and gave him the name that is above every name </s>
<s> that at the name of jesus every knee should bow  in heaven and on earth and under the earth </s>
<s> and every tongue acknowledge that jesus christ is lord  to the glory of god the father </s>
<s> therefore  my dear friends  as you have always obeyed  not only in my presence  but now much more in my absence  continue to work out your salvation with fear and trembling </s>
<s> for it is god who works in you to will and to act in order to fulfil his good purpose </s>
<s> do everything without grumbling or arguing </s>
<s> so that you may become blameless and pure   children of god without fault in a warped and crooked generation   then you will shine among them like stars in the sky</s>
<s> as you hold firmly to the word of life  and then i will be able to boast on the day of christ that i did not run or labour in vain </s>
<s> but even if i am being poured out like a drink offering on the sacrifice and service coming from your faith  i am glad and rejoice with all of you </s>
<s> so you too should be glad and rejoice with me </s>
<s> i hope in the lord jesus to send timothy to you soon  that i also may be cheered when i receive news about you </s>
<s> i have no one else like him  who will show genuine concern for your welfare </s>
<s> for everyone looks out for their own interests  not those of jesus christ </s>
<s> but you know that timothy has proved himself  because as a son with his father he has served with me in the work of the gospel </s>
<s> i hope  therefore  to send him as soon as i see how things go with me </s>
<s> and i am confident in the lord that i myself will come soon </s>
<s> but i think it is necessary to send back to you epaphroditus  my brother  coworker and fellow soldier  who is also your messenger  whom you sent to take care of my needs </s>
<s> for he longs for all of you and is distressed because you heard he was ill </s>
<s> indeed he was ill  and almost died  but god had mercy on him  and not on him only but also on me  to spare me sorrow upon sorrow </s>
<s> therefore i am all the more eager to send him  so that when you see him again you may be glad and i may have less anxiety </s>
<s> so then  welcome him in the lord with great joy  and honour people like him </s>
<s> because he almost died for the work of christ  he risked his life to make up for the help you yourselves could not give me </s>
<s> further  my brothers and sisters  rejoice in the lord  it is no trouble for me to write the same things to you again  and it is a safeguard for you </s>
<s> watch out for those dogs  those evildoers  those mutilators of the flesh </s>
<s> for it is we who are the circumcision  we who serve god by his spirit  who boast in christ jesus  and who put no confidence in the flesh </s>
<s> though i myself have reasons for such confidence  if someone else thinks they have reasons to put confidence in the flesh  i have more </s>
<s> circumcised on the eighth day  of the people of israel  of the tribe of benjamin  a hebrew of hebrews  in regard to the law  a pharisee </s>
<s> as for zeal  persecuting the church  as for righteousness based on the law  faultless </s>
<s> but whatever were gains to me i now consider loss for the sake of christ </s>
<s> what is more  i consider everything a loss because of the surpassing worth of knowing christ jesus my lord  for whose sake i have lost all things  i consider them garbage  that i may gain christ</s>
<s> and be found in him  not having a righteousness of my own that comes from the law  but that which is through faith in christ  the righteousness that comes from god on the basis of faith </s>
<s> i want to know christ  yes  to know the power of his resurrection and participation in his sufferings  becoming like him in his death </s>
<s> and so  somehow  attaining to the resurrection from the dead </s>
<s> not that i have already obtained all this  or have already arrived at my goal  but i press on to take hold of that for which christ jesus took hold of me </s>
<s> brothers and sisters  i do not consider myself yet to have taken hold of it  but one thing i do  forgettting what is behind and straining towards what is ahead </s>
<s> i press on towards the goal to win the prize for which god has called me heavenwards in christ jesus </s>
<s> all of us  then  who are mature should take such a view of things  and if on some point you think differently  that too god will make clear to you </s>
<s> only let us live up to what we have already attained </s>
<s> join together in following my example  brothers and sisters  and just as you have us as a model  keep your eyes on those who live as we do </s>
<s> for  as i have often told you before and now tell you again even with tears  many live as enemies of the cross of christ </s>
<s> their destiny is destruction  their god is their stomach  and their glory is in their shame  their mind is set on earthly things </s>
<s> but our citizenship is in heaven  and we eagerly await a saviour from there  the lord jesus christ </s>
<s> who  by the power that enables him to bring everything under his control  will transform our lowly bodies so that they will be like his glorious body </s>
<s> therefore  my brothers and sisters  you whom i love and long for  my joy and crown  stand firm in the lord in this way  dear friends </s>
<s> i plead with euodia and i plead with syntyche to be of the same mind in the lord </s>
<s> yes  and i ask you  my true companion  help these women since they have contended at my side in the cause of the gospel  along with clement and the rest of my coworkers  whose names are in the book of life </s>
<s> rejoice in the lord always  i will say it again  rejoice </s>
<s> let your gentleness be evident to all  the lord is near </s>
<s> do not be anxious about anything  but in every situation  by prayer and petition  with thanksgiving  present your requests to god </s>
<s> and the peace of god  which transcends all understanding  will guard your hearts and your minds in christ jesus </s>
<s> finally  brothers and sisters  whatever is true  whatever is noble  whatever is right  whatever is pure  whatever is lovely  whatever is admirable  if anything is excellent or praiseworthy  think about such things </s>
<s> whatever you have learned or received or heard from me  or seen in me  put it into practice  and the god of peace will be with you </s>
<s> i rejoiced greatly in the lord that at last you renewed your concern for me  indeed  you were concerned  but you had no opportunity to show it </s>
<s> i am not saying this because i am in need  for i have learned to be content whatever the circumstances </s>
<s> i know what it is to be in need  and i know what it is to have plenty  i have learned the secret of being content in any and every situation  whether well fed or hungry  whether living in plenty or in want </s>
<s> i can do all this through him who gives me strength </s>
<s> yet it was good of you to share in my troubles </s>
<s> moreover  as you philippians know  in the early days of your acquaintance with the gospel  when i set out from macedonia  not one church shared with me in the matter of giving and receiving  except you only </s>
<s> for even when i was in thessalonica  you sent me aid more than once when i was in need </s>
<s> not that i desire your gifts  what i desire is that more be credited to your account </s>
<s> i have received full payment and have more than enough  i am amply supplied  now that i have received from epaphroditus the gifts you sent  they are a fragrant offering  an acceptable sacrifice  pleasing to god </s>
<s> and my god will meet all your needs according to the riches of his glory in christ jesus </s>
<s> to our god and father be glory for ever and ever  amen </s>
<s> greet all gods people in christ jesus  the brothers and sisters who are with me send greetings </s>
<s> all gods people here send you greetings  especially those who belong to caesars household </s>
<s> the grace of the lord jesus christ be with your spirit  amen </s>
<s> paul  an apostle of christ jesus by the will of god  and timothy our brother </s>
<s> to gods holy people in colossae  the faithful brothers and sisters in christ  grace and peace to you from god our father </s>
<s> we always thank god  the father of our lord jesus christ  when we pray for you </s>
<s> because we have heard of your faith in christ jesus and of the love you have for all gods people </s>
<s> the faith and love that spring from the hope stored up for you in heaven and about which you have already heard in the true message of the gospel</s>
<s> that has come to you  in the same way  the gospel is bearing fruit and growing throughout the whole world  just as it has been doing among you since the day you heard it and truly understood gods grace </s>
<s> you learned it from epaphras  our dear fellow servant  who is a faithful minister of christ on our behalf </s>
<s> and who also told us of your love in the spirit </s>
<s> for this reason  since the day we heard about you  we have not stopped praying for you  we continually ask god to fill you with the knowledge of his will through all the wisdom and understanding that the spirit gives </s>
<s> so that you may live a life worthy of the lord and please him in every way  bearing fruit in every good work  growing in the knowledge of god </s>
<s> being strengthened with all power according to his glorious might so that you may have great endurance and patience </s>
<s> and giving joyful thanks to the father  who has qualified you to share in the inheritance of his holy people in the kingdom of light </s>
<s> for he has rescued us from the dominion of darkness and brought us into the kingdom of the son he loves </s>
<s> in whom we have redemption  the forgiveness of sins </s>
<s> the son is the image of the invisible god  the firstborn over all creation </s>
<s> for in him all things were created  things in heaven and on earth  visible and invisible  whether thrones or powers or rulers or authorities  all things have been created through him and for him </s>
<s> he is before all things  and in him all things hold together </s>
<s> and he is the head of the body  the church  he is the beginning and the firstborn from among the dead  so that in everything he might have the supremacy </s>
<s> for god was pleased to have all his fulness dwell in him </s>
<s> and through him to reconcile to himself all things  whether things on earth or things in heaven  by making peace through his blood  shed on the cross </s>
<s> once you were alienated from god and were enemies in your minds because of your evil behaviour </s>
<s> but now he has reconciled you by christs physical body through death to present you holy in his sight  without blemish and free from accusation </s>
<s> if you continue in your faith  established and firm  and do not move from the hope held out in the gospel  this is the gospel that you heard and that has been proclaimed to every creature under heaven  and of which i  paul  have become a servant </s>
<s> now i rejoice in what i am suffering for you  and i fill up in my flesh what is still lacking in regard to christs afflictions  for the sake of his body  which is the church </s>
<s> i have become its servant by the commission god gave me to present to you the word of god in its fulness </s>
<s> the mystery that has been kept hidden for ages and generations  but is now disclosed to the lords people </s>
<s> to them god has chosen to make known among the gentiles the glorious riches of this mystery  which is christ in you  the hope of glory </s>
<s> he is the one we proclaim  admonishing and teaching everyone with all wisdom  so that we may present everyone fully mature in christ </s>
<s> to this end i strenuously contend with all the energy christ so powerfully works in me </s>
<s> i want you to know how hard i am contending for you and for those at laodicea  and for all who have not met me personally </s>
<s> my goal is that they may be encouraged in heart and united in love  so that they may have the full riches of complete understanding  in order that they may know the mystery of god  namely  christ </s>
<s> in whom are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge </s>
<s> i tell you this so that no one may deceive you by finesounding arguments </s>
<s> for though i am absent from you in body  i am present with you in spirit and delight to see how disciplined you are and how firm your faith in christ is </s>
<s> so then  just as you received christ jesus as lord  continue to live your lives in him </s>
<s> rooted and built up in him  strengthened in the faith as you were taught  and overflowing with thankfulness </s>
<s> see to it that no one takes you captive through hollow and deceptive philosophy  which depends on human tradition and the elemental spiritual forces of this world rather than on christ </s>
<s> for in christ all the fulness of the deity lives in bodily form </s>
<s> and in christ you have been brought to fulness  he is the head over every power and authority </s>
<s> in him you were also circumcised with a circumcision not performed by human hands  your whole self ruled by the flesh was put off when you were circumcised by christ </s>
<s> having been buried with him in baptism  in which you were also raised with him through your faith in the working of god  who raised him from the dead </s>
<s> when you were dead in your sins and in the uncircumcision of your flesh  god made you alive with christ  he forgave us all our sins </s>
<s> having cancelled the charge of our legal indebtedness  which stood against us and condemned us  he has taken it away  nailing it to the cross </s>
<s> and having disarmed the powers and authorities  he made a public spectacle of them  triumphing over them by the cross </s>
<s> therefore do not let anyone judge you by what you eat or drink  or with regard to a religious festival  a new moon celebration or a sabbath day </s>
<s> these are a shadow of the things that were to come  the reality  however  is found in christ </s>
<s> do not let anyone who delights in false humility and the worship of angels disqualify you  such a person also goes into great detail about what they have seen  they are puffed up with idle notions by their unspiritual mind </s>
<s> they have lost connection with the head  from whom the whole body  supported and held together by its ligaments and sinews  grows as god causes it to grow </s>
<s> since you died with christ to the elemental spiritual forces of this world  why  as though you still belonged to the world  do you submit to its rules </s>
<s>  do not handle  do not taste  do not touch   </s>
<s> these rules  which have to do with things that are all destined to perish with use  are based on merely human commands and teachings </s>
<s> such regulations indeed have an appearance of wisdom  with their selfimposed worship  their false humility and their harsh treatment of the body  but they lack any value in restraining sensual indulgence </s>
<s> since  then  you have been raised with christ  set your hearts on things above  where christ is  seated at the right hand of god </s>
<s> set your minds on things above  not on earthly things </s>
<s> for you died  and your life is now hidden with christ in god </s>
<s> when christ  who is your life  appears  then you also will appear with him in glory </s>
<s> put to death  therefore  whatever belongs to your earthly nature  sexual immorality  impurity  lust  evil desires and greed  which is idolatry </s>
<s> because of these  the wrath of god is coming </s>
<s> you used to walk in these ways  in the life you once lived </s>
<s> but now you must also rid yourselves of all such things as these  anger  rage  malice  slander  and filthy language from your lips </s>
<s> do not lie to each other  since you have taken off your old self with its practices</s>
<s> and have put on the new self  which is being renewed in knowledge in the image of its creator </s>
<s> here there is no gentile or jew  circumcised or uncircumcised  barbarian  scythian  slave or free  but christ is all  and is in all </s>
<s> therefore  as gods chosen people  holy and dearly loved  clothe yourselves with compassion  kindness  humility  gentleness and patience </s>
<s> bear with each other and forgive one another if any of you has a grievance against someone  forgive as the lord forgave you </s>
<s> and over all these virtues put on love  which binds them all together in perfect unity </s>
<s> let the peace of christ rule in your hearts  since as members of one body you were called to peace  and be thankful </s>
<s> let the message of christ dwell among you richly as you teach and admonish one another with all wisdom through psalms  hymns  and songs from the spirit  singing to god with gratitude in your hearts </s>
<s> and whatever you do  whether in word or deed  do it all in the name of the lord jesus  giving thanks to god the father through him </s>
<s> wives  submit yourselves to your husbands  as is fitting in the lord </s>
<s> husbands  love your wives and do not be harsh with them </s>
<s> children  obey your parents in everything  for this pleases the lord </s>
<s> fathers  do not embitter your children  or they will become discouraged </s>
<s> slaves  obey your earthly masters in everything  and do it  not only when their eye is on you and to curry their favour  but with sincerity of heart and reverence for the lord </s>
<s> whatever you do  work at it with all your heart  as working for the lord  not for human masters </s>
<s> since you know that you will receive an inheritance from the lord as a reward  it is the lord christ you are serving </s>
<s> anyone who does wrong will be repaid for their wrongs  and there is no favouritism </s>
<s> masters  provide your slaves with what is right and fair  because you know that you also have a master in heaven </s>
<s> devote yourselves to prayer  being watchful and thankful </s>
<s> and pray for us  too  that god may open a door for our message  so that we may proclaim the mystery of christ  for which i am in chains </s>
<s> pray that i may proclaim it clearly  as i should </s>
<s> be wise in the way you act towards outsiders  make the most of every opportunity </s>
<s> let your conversation be always full of grace  seasoned with salt  so that you may know how to answer everyone </s>
<s> tychicus will tell you all the news about me  he is a dear brother  a faithful minister and fellow servant in the lord </s>
<s> i am sending him to you for the express purpose that you may know about our circumstances and that he may encourage your hearts </s>

<s> epaphras  who is one of you and a servant of christ jesus  sends greetings  he is always wrestling in prayer for you  that you may stand firm in all the will of god  mature and fully assured </s>
<s> i vouch for him that he is working hard for you and for those at laodicea and hierapolis </s>
<s> our dear friend luke  the doctor  and demas send greetings </s>
<s> give my greetings to the brothers and sisters at laodicea  and to nympha and the church in her house </s>
<s> after this letter has been read to you  see that it is also read in the church of the laodiceans and that you in turn read the letter from laodicea </s>
<s> tell archippus   see to it that you complete the ministry you have received in the lord  </s>
<s> i  paul  write this greeting in my own hand  remember my chains  grace be with you </s>
<s> paul  silas and timothy  to the church of the thessalonians in god the father and the lord jesus christ  grace and peace to you </s>
<s> we always thank god for all of you and continually mention you in our prayers </s>
<s> we remember before our god and father your work produced by faith  your labour prompted by love  and your endurance inspired by hope in our lord jesus christ </s>
<s> for we know  brothers and sisters loved by god  that he has chosen you </s>
<s> because our gospel came to you not simply with words but also with power  with the holy spirit and deep conviction  you know how we lived among you for your sake </s>
<s> you became imitators of us and of the lord  for you welcomed the message in the midst of severe suffering with the joy given by the holy spirit </s>
<s> and so you became a model to all the believers in macedonia and achaia </s>
<s> the lords message rang out from you not only in macedonia and achaia  your faith in god has become known everywhere  therefore we do not need to say anything about it </s>
<s> for they themselves report what kind of reception you gave us  they tell how you turned to god from idols to serve the living and true god </s>
<s> and to wait for his son from heaven  whom he raised from the dead  jesus  who rescues us from the coming wrath </s>
<s> you know  brothers and sisters  that our visit to you was not without results </s>
<s> we had previously suffered and been treated outrageously in philippi  as you know  but with the help of our god we dared to tell you his gospel in the face of strong opposition </s>
<s> for the appeal we make does not spring from error or impure motives  nor are we trying to trick you </s>
<s> on the contrary  we speak as those approved by god to be entrusted with the gospel  we are not trying to please people but god  who tests our hearts </s>
<s> you know we never used flattery  nor did we put on a mask to cover up greed  god is our witness </s>
<s> we were not looking for praise from people  not from you or anyone else  even though as apostles of christ we could have asserted our authority </s>
<s> instead  we were like young children among you  just as a nursing mother cares for her children </s>
<s> so we cared for you  because we loved you so much  we were delighted to share with you not only the gospel of god but our lives as well </s>
<s> surely you remember  brothers and sisters  our toil and hardship  we worked night and day in order not to be a burden to anyone while we preached the gospel of god to you </s>
<s> you are witnesses  and so is god  of how holy  righteous and blameless we were among you who believed </s>
<s> for you know that we dealt with each of you as a father deals with his own children </s>
<s> encouraging  comforting and urging you to live lives worthy of god  who calls you into his kingdom and glory </s>
<s> and we also thank god continually because  when you received the word of god  which you heard from us  you accepted it not as a human word  but as it actually is  the word of god  which is indeed at work in you who believe </s>
<s> for you  brothers and sisters  became imitators of gods churches in judea  which are in christ jesus  you suffered from your own people the same things those churches suffered from the jews</s>
<s> who killed the lord jesus and the prophets and also drove us out  they displease god and are hostile to everyone</s>
<s> in their effort to keep us from speaking to the gentiles so that they may be saved  in this way they always heap up their sins to the limit  the wrath of god has come upon them at last </s>
<s> but  brothers and sisters  when we were orphaned by being separated from you for a short time  in person  not in thought   out of our intense longing we made every effort to see you </s>
<s> for we wanted to come to you  certainly i  paul  did  again and again  but satan blocked our way </s>
<s> for what is our hope  our joy  or the crown in which we will glory in the presence of our lord jesus when he comes  is it not you </s>
<s> indeed  you are our glory and joy </s>
<s> so when we could stand it no longer  we thought it best to be left by ourselves in athens </s>
<s> we sent timothy  who is our brother and coworker in gods service in spreading the gospel of christ  to strengthen and encourage you in your faith </s>
<s> so that no one would be unsettled by these trials  for you know quite well that we are destined for them </s>
<s> in fact  when we were with you  we kept telling you that we would be persecuted  and it turned out that way  as you well know </s>
<s> for this reason  when i could stand it no longer  i sent to find out about your faith  i was afraid that in some way the tempter had tempted you and that our labours might have been in vain </s>
<s> but timothy has just now come to us from you and has brought good news about your faith and love  he has told us that you always have pleasant memories of us and that you long to see us  just as we also long to see you </s>
<s> therefore  brothers and sisters  in all our distress and persecution we were encouraged about you because of your faith </s>
<s> for now we really live  since you are standing firm in the lord </s>
<s> how can we thank god enough for you in return for all the joy we have in the presence of our god because of you </s>
<s> night and day we pray most earnestly that we may see you again and supply what is lacking in your faith </s>
<s> now may our god and father himself and our lord jesus clear the way for us to come to you </s>
<s> may the lord make your love increase and overflow for each other and for everyone else  just as ours does for you </s>
<s> may he strengthen your hearts so that you will be blameless and holy in the presence of our god and father when our lord jesus comes with all his holy ones </s>
<s> as for other matters  brothers and sisters  we instructed you how to live in order to please god  as in fact you are living  now we ask you and urge you in the lord jesus to do this more and more </s>
<s> for you know what instructions we gave you by the authority of the lord jesus </s>
<s> it is gods will that you should be sanctified  that you should avoid sexual immorality </s>
<s> that each of you should learn to control your own body in a way that is holy and honourable </s>
<s> not in passionate lust like the pagans  who do not know god </s>
<s> and that in this matter no one should wrong or take advantage of a brother or sister  the lord will punish all those who commit such sins  as we told you and warned you before </s>
<s> for god did not call us to be impure  but to live a holy life </s>
<s> therefore  anyone who rejects this instruction does not reject a human being but god  the very god who gives you his holy spirit </s>
<s> now about your love for one another we do not need to write to you  for you yourselves have been taught by god to love each other </s>
<s> and in fact  you do love all of gods family throughout macedonia  yet we urge you  brothers and sisters  to do so more and more </s>
<s> and to make it your ambition to lead a quiet life  you should mind your own business and work with your hands  just as we told you </s>
<s> so that your daily life may win the respect of outsiders and so that you will not be dependent on anybody </s>
<s> brothers and sisters  we do not want you to be uninformed about those who sleep in death  so that you do not grieve like the rest of mankind  who have no hope </s>
<s> for we believe that jesus died and rose again  and so we believe that god will bring with jesus those who have fallen asleep in him </s>
<s> according to the lords word  we tell you that we who are still alive  who are left until the coming of the lord  will certainly not precede those who have fallen asleep </s>
<s> for the lord himself will come down from heaven  with a loud command  with the voice of the archangel and with the trumpet call of god  and the dead in christ will rise first </s>
<s> after that  we who are still alive and are left will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the lord in the air  and so we will be with the lord for ever </s>
<s> therefore encourage one another with these words </s>
<s> now  brothers and sisters  about times and dates we do not need to write to you </s>
<s> for you know very well that the day of the lord will come like a thief in the night </s>
<s> while people are saying   peace and safety  destruction will come on them suddenly  as labour pains on a pregnant woman  and they will not escape </s>
<s> but you  brothers and sisters  are not in darkness so that this day should surprise you like a thief </s>
<s> you are all children of the light and children of the day  we do not belong to the night or to the darkness </s>
<s> so then  let us not be like others  who are asleep  but let us be awake and sober </s>
<s> for those who sleep  sleep at night  and those who get drunk  get drunk at night </s>
<s> but since we belong to the day  let us be sober  putting on faith and love as a breastplate  and the hope of salvation as a helmet </s>
<s> for god did not appoint us to suffer wrath but to receive salvation through our lord jesus christ </s>
<s> he died for us so that  whether we are awake or asleep  we may live together with him </s>
<s> therefore encourage one another and build each other up  just as in fact you are doing </s>
<s> now we ask you  brothers and sisters  to acknowledge those who work hard among you  who care for you in the lord and who admonish you </s>
<s> hold them in the highest regard in love because of their work  live in peace with each other </s>
<s> and we urge you  brothers and sisters  warn those who are idle and disruptive  encourage the disheartened  help the weak  be patient with everyone </s>
<s> make sure that nobody pays back wrong for wrong  but always strive to do what is good for each other and for everyone else </s>
<s> rejoice always </s>
<s> pray continually </s>
<s> give thanks in all circumstances  for this is gods will for you in christ jesus </s>
<s> do not quench the spirit </s>
<s> do not treat prophecies with contempt</s>
<s> but test them all  hold on to what is good </s>
<s> reject every kind of evil </s>
<s> may god himself  the god of peace  sanctify you through and through  may your whole spirit  soul and body be kept blameless at the coming of our lord jesus christ </s>
<s> the one who calls you is faithful  and he will do it </s>
<s> brothers and sisters  pray for us </s>
<s> greet all gods people with a holy kiss </s>
<s> i charge you before the lord to have this letter read to all the brothers and sisters </s>
<s> the grace of our lord jesus christ be with you </s>
<s> paul  silas and timothy  to the church of the thessalonians in god our father and the lord jesus christ </s>
<s> grace and peace to you from god the father and the lord jesus christ </s>
<s> we ought always to thank god for you  brothers and sisters  and rightly so  because your faith is growing more and more  and the love all of you have for one another is increasing </s>
<s> therefore  among gods churches we boast about your perseverance and faith in all the persecutions and trials you are enduring </s>
<s> all this is evidence that gods judgment is right  and as a result you will be counted worthy of the kingdom of god  for which you are suffering </s>
<s> god is just  he will pay back trouble to those who trouble you</s>
<s> and give relief to you who are troubled  and to us as well  this will happen when the lord jesus is revealed from heaven in blazing fire with his powerful angels </s>
<s> he will punish those who do not know god and do not obey the gospel of our lord jesus </s>
<s> they will be punished with everlasting destruction and shut out from the presence of the lord and from the glory of his might</s>
<s> on the day he comes to be glorified in his holy people and to be marvelled at among all those who have believed  this includes you  because you believed our testimony to you </s>
<s> with this in mind  we constantly pray for you  that our god may make you worthy of his calling  and that by his power he may bring to fruition your every desire for goodness and your every deed prompted by faith </s>
<s> we pray this so that the name of our lord jesus may be glorified in you  and you in him  according to the grace of our god and the lord jesus christ </s>
<s> concerning the coming of our lord jesus christ and our being gathered to him  we ask you  brothers and sisters </s>
<s> not to become easily unsettled or alarmed by the teaching allegedly from us  whether by a prophecy or by word of mouth or by letter  asserting that the day of the lord has already come </s>
<s> dont let anyone deceive you in any way  for that day will not come until the rebellion occurs and the man of lawlessness is revealed  the man doomed to destruction </s>
<s> he will oppose and will exalt himself over everything that is called god or is worshipped  so that he sets himself up in gods temple  proclaiming himself to be god </s>
<s> dont you remember that when i was with you i used to tell you these things </s>
<s> and now you know what is holding him back  so that he may be revealed at the proper time </s>
<s> for the secret power of lawlessness is already at work  but the one who now holds it back will continue to do so till he is taken out of the way </s>
<s> and then the lawless one will be revealed  whom the lord jesus will overthrow with the breath of his mouth and destroy by the splendour of his coming </s>
<s> the coming of the lawless one will be in accordance with how satan works  he will use all sorts of displays of power through signs and wonders that serve the lie </s>
<s> and all the ways that wickedness deceives those who are perishing  they perish because they refused to love the truth and so be saved </s>
<s> for this reason god sends them a powerful delusion so that they will believe the lie</s>
<s> and so that all will be condemned who have not believed the truth but have delighted in wickedness </s>
<s> but we ought always to thank god for you  brothers and sisters loved by the lord  because god chose you as firstfruits to be saved through the sanctifying work of the spirit and through belief in the truth </s>
<s> he called you to this through our gospel  that you might share in the glory of our lord jesus christ </s>
<s> so then  brothers and sisters  stand firm and hold fast to the teachings we passed on to you  whether by word of mouth or by letter </s>
<s> may our lord jesus christ himself and god our father  who loved us and by his grace gave us eternal encouragement and good hope </s>
<s> encourage your hearts and strengthen you in every good deed and word </s>
<s> as for other matters  brothers and sisters  pray for us that the message of the lord may spread rapidly and be honoured  just as it was with you </s>
<s> and pray that we may be delivered from wicked and evil people  for not everyone has faith </s>
<s> but the lord is faithful  and he will strengthen you and protect you from the evil one </s>
<s> we have confidence in the lord that you are doing and will continue to do the things we command </s>
<s> may the lord direct your hearts into gods love and christs perseverance </s>
<s> in the name of the lord jesus christ  we command you  brothers and sisters  to keep away from every believer who is idle and disruptive and does not live according to the teaching you received from us </s>
<s> for you yourselves know how you ought to follow our example  we were not idle when we were with you </s>
<s> nor did we eat anyones food without paying for it  on the contrary  we worked night and day  labouring and toiling so that we would not be a burden to any of you </s>
<s> we did this  not because we do not have the right to such help  but in order to offer ourselves as a model for you to imitate </s>
<s> for even when we were with you  we gave you this rule   the one who is unwilling to work shall not eat  </s>
<s> we hear that some among you are idle and disruptive  they are not busy  they are busybodies </s>
<s> such people we command and urge in the lord jesus christ to settle down and earn the food they eat </s>
<s> and as for you  brothers and sisters  never tire of doing what is good </s>
<s> take special note of anyone who does not obey our instruction in this letter  do not associate with them  in order that they may feel ashamed </s>
<s> yet do not regard them as an enemy  but warn them as you would a fellow believer </s>
<s> now may the lord of peace himself give you peace at all times and in every way  the lord be with all of you </s>
<s> i  paul  write this greeting in my own hand  which is the distinguishing mark in all my letters  this is how i write </s>
<s> the grace of our lord jesus christ be with you all </s>
<s> paul  an apostle of christ jesus by the command of god our saviour and of christ jesus our hope </s>
<s> to timothy my true son in the faith  grace  mercy and peace from god the father and christ jesus our lord </s>
<s> as i urged you when i went into macedonia  stay there in ephesus so that you may command certain people not to teach false doctrines any longer</s>
<s> or to devote themselves to myths and endless genealogies  such things promote controversial speculations rather than advancing gods work  which is by faith </s>
<s> the goal of this command is love  which comes from a pure heart and a good conscience and a sincere faith </s>
<s> some have departed from these and have turned to meaningless talk </s>
<s> they want to be teachers of the law  but they do not know what they are talking about or what they so confidently affirm </s>
<s> we know that the law is good if one uses it properly </s>
<s> we also know that the law is made not for the righteous but for lawbreakers and rebels  the ungodly and sinful  the unholy and irreligious  for those who kill their fathers or mothers  for murderers </s>
<s> for the sexually immoral  for those practising homosexuality  for slave traders and liars and perjurers  and for whatever else is contrary to the sound doctrine</s>
<s> that conforms to the gospel concerning the glory of the blessed god  which he entrusted to me </s>
<s> i thank christ jesus our lord  who has given me strength  that he considered me trustworthy  appointing me to his service </s>
<s> even though i was once a blasphemer and a persecutor and a violent man  i was shown mercy because i acted in ignorance and unbelief </s>
<s> the grace of our lord was poured out on me abundantly  along with the faith and love that are in christ jesus </s>
<s> here is a trustworthy saying that deserves full acceptance  christ jesus came into the world to save sinners  of whom i am the worst </s>
<s> but for that very reason i was shown mercy so that in me  the worst of sinners  christ jesus might display his immense patience as an example for those who would believe in him and receive eternal life </s>
<s> now to the king eternal  immortal  invisible  the only god  be honour and glory for ever and ever  amen </s>
<s> timothy  my son  i am giving you this command in keeping with the prophecies once made about you  so that by recalling them you may fight the battle well </s>
<s> holding on to faith and a good conscience  which some have rejected and so have suffered shipwreck with regard to the faith </s>
<s> among them are hymenaeus and alexander  whom i have handed over to satan to be taught not to blaspheme </s>
<s> i urge  then  first of all  that petitions  prayers  intercession and thanksgiving be made for all people </s>
<s> for kings and all those in authority  that we may live peaceful and quiet lives in all godliness and holiness </s>
<s> this is good  and pleases god our saviour </s>
<s> who wants all people to be saved and to come to a knowledge of the truth </s>
<s> for there is one god and one mediator between god and mankind  the man christ jesus </s>
<s> who gave himself as a ransom for all people  this has now been witnessed to at the proper time </s>
<s> and for this purpose i was appointed a herald and an apostle  i am telling the truth  i am not lying  and a true and faithful teacher of the gentiles </s>
<s> therefore i want the men everywhere to pray  lifting up holy hands without anger or disputing </s>
<s> i also want the women to dress modestly  with decency and propriety  adorning themselves  not with elaborate hairstyles or gold or pearls or expensive clothes </s>
<s> but with good deeds  appropriate for women who profess to worship god </s>
<s> a woman should learn in quietness and full submission </s>
<s> i do not permit a woman to teach or to assume authority over a man  she must be quiet </s>
<s> for adam was formed first  then eve </s>
<s> and adam was not the one deceived  it was the woman who was deceived and became a sinner </s>

<s> give the people these instructions  so that no one may be open to blame </s>

<s> we must pay the most careful attention  therefore  to what we have heard  so that we do not drift away </s>
<s> for since the message spoken through angels was binding  and every violation and disobedience received its just punishment </s>
<s> how shall we escape if we ignore so great a salvation  this salvation  which was first announced by the lord  was confirmed to us by those who heard him </s>
<s> god also testified to it by signs  wonders and various miracles  and by gifts of the holy spirit distributed according to his will </s>
<s> it is not to angels that he has subjected the world to come  about which we are speaking </s>
<s> but there is a place where someone has testified   what is mankind that you are mindful of them  a son of man that you care for him </s>
<s> you made them a little lower than the angels  you crowned them with glory and honour</s>
<s> and put everything under their feet   </s>
<s> in bringing many sons and daughters to glory  it was fitting that god  for whom and through whom everything exists  should make the pioneer of their salvation perfect through what he suffered </s>
<s> both the one who makes people holy and those who are made holy are of the same family  so jesus is not ashamed to call them brothers and sisters </s>
<s> he says   i will declare your name to my brothers and sisters  in the assembly i will sing your praises    i will put my trust in him    here am i  and the children god has given me  </s>
<s> since the children have flesh and blood  he too shared in their humanity so that by his death he might break the power of him who holds the power of death  that is  the devil </s>
<s> and free those who all their lives were held in slavery by their fear of death </s>
<s> for surely it is not angels he helps  but abrahams descendants </s>
<s> for this reason he had to be made like them  fully human in every way  in order that he might become a merciful and faithful high priest in service to god  and that he might make atonement for the sins of the people </s>
<s> because he himself suffered when he was tempted  he is able to help those who are being tempted </s>
<s> therefore  holy brothers and sisters  who share in the heavenly calling  fix your thoughts on jesus  whom we acknowledge as our apostle and high priest </s>
<s> he was faithful to the one who appointed him  just as moses was faithful in all gods house </s>
<s> jesus has been found worthy of greater honour than moses  just as the builder of a house has greater honour than the house itself </s>
<s> for every house is built by someone  but god is the builder of everything </s>
<s>  moses was faithful as a servant in all gods house   bearing witness to what would be spoken by god in the future </s>
<s> but christ is faithful as the son over gods house  and we are his house  if indeed we hold firmly to our confidence and the hope in which we glory </s>
<s> so  as the holy spirit says   today  if you hear his voice </s>
<s> do not harden your hearts as you did in the rebellion  during the time of testing in the wilderness </s>
<s> where your ancestors tested and tried me  though for forty years they saw what i did </s>
<s> that is why i was angry with that generation  i said   their hearts are always going astray  and they have not known my ways  </s>
<s> so i declared on oath in my anger   they shall never enter my rest   </s>
<s> see to it  brothers and sisters  that none of you has a sinful  unbelieving heart that turns away from the living god </s>
<s> but encourage one another daily  as long as it is called  today  so that none of you may be hardened by sins deceitfulness </s>
<s> we have come to share in christ  if indeed we hold our original conviction firmly to the very end </s>
<s> as has just been said   today  if you hear his voice  do not harden your hearts as you did in the rebellion  </s>
<s> who were they who heard and rebelled  were they not all those moses led out of egypt </s>
<s> and with whom was he angry for forty years  was it not with those who sinned  whose bodies perished in the wilderness </s>
<s> and to whom did god swear that they would never enter his rest if not to those who disobeyed </s>
<s> so we see that they were not able to enter  because of their unbelief </s>
<s> therefore  since the promise of entering his rest still stands  let us be careful that none of you be found to have fallen short of it </s>
<s> for we also have had the good news proclaimed to us  just as they did  but the message they heard was of no value to them  because they did not share the faith of those who obeyed </s>
<s> now we who have believed enter that rest  just as god has said   so i declared on oath in my anger   they shall never enter my rest   </s>
<s> therefore since it still remains for some to enter that rest  and since those who formerly had the good news proclaimed to them did not go in because of their disobedience </s>
<s> god again set a certain day  calling it  today  this he did when a long time later he spoke through david  as in the passage already quoted   today  if you hear his voice  do not harden your hearts  </s>
<s> for the word of god is alive and active  sharper than any doubleedged sword  it penetrates even to dividing soul and spirit  joints and marrow  it judges the thoughts and attitudes of the heart </s>
<s> nothing in all creation is hidden from gods sight  everything is uncovered and laid bare before the eyes of him to whom we must give account </s>
<s> therefore  since we have a great high priest who has ascended into heaven  jesus the son of god  let us hold firmly to the faith we profess </s>
<s> for we do not have a high priest who is unable to feel sympathy for our weaknesses  but we have one who has been tempted in every way  just as we are  yet he did not sin </s>
<s> let us then approach gods throne of grace with confidence  so that we may receive mercy and find grace to help us in our time of need </s>
<s> every high priest is selected from among the people and is appointed to represent the people in matters related to god  to offer gifts and sacrifices for sins </s>
<s> he is able to deal gently with those who are ignorant and are going astray  since he himself is subject to weakness </s>
<s> this is why he has to offer sacrifices for his own sins  as well as for the sins of the people </s>
<s> and no one takes this honour on himself  but he receives it when called by god  just as aaron was </s>
<s> in the same way  christ did not take on himself the glory of becoming a high priest  but god said to him   you are my son  today i have become your father    you are a priest for ever  in the order of melchizedek  </s>
<s> during the days of jesus life on earth  he offered up prayers and petitions with fervent cries and tears to the one who could save him from death  and he was heard because of his reverent submission </s>
<s> son though he was  he learned obedience from what he suffered</s>
<s> and  once made perfect  he became the source of eternal salvation for all who obey him</s>
<s> and was designated by god to be high priest in the order of melchizedek </s>
<s> we have much to say about this  but it is hard to make it clear to you because you no longer try to understand </s>
<s> in fact  though by this time you ought to be teachers  you need someone to teach you the elementary truths of gods word all over again  you need milk  not solid food </s>
<s> anyone who lives on milk  being still an infant  is not acquainted with the teaching about righteousness </s>
<s> but solid food is for the mature  who by constant use have trained themselves to distinguish good from evil </s>
<s> therefore let us move beyond the elementary teachings about christ and be taken forward to maturity  not laying again the foundation of repentance from acts that lead to death  and of faith in god </s>
<s> instruction about cleansing rites  the laying on of hands  the resurrection of the dead  and eternal judgment </s>
<s> and god permitting  we will do so </s>
<s> it is impossible for those who have once been enlightened  who have tasted the heavenly gift  who have shared in the holy spirit </s>
<s> who have tasted the goodness of the word of god and the powers of the coming age</s>
<s> and who have fallen away  to be brought back to repentance  to their loss they are crucifying the son of god all over again and subjecting him to public disgrace </s>
<s> land that drinks in the rain often falling on it and that produces a crop useful to those for whom it is farmed receives the blessing of god </s>
<s> but land that produces thorns and thistles is worthless and is in danger of being cursed  in the end it will be burned </s>
<s> even though we speak like this  dear friends  we are convinced of better things in your case  the things that have to do with salvation </s>
<s> god is not unjust  he will not forget your work and the love you have shown him as you have helped his people and continue to help them </s>
<s> we want each of you to show this same diligence to the very end  so that what you hope for may be fully realized </s>
<s> we do not want you to become lazy  but to imitate those who through faith and patience inherit what has been promised </s>
<s> when god made his promise to abraham  since there was no one greater for him to swear by  he swore by himself </s>
<s> saying   i will surely bless you and give you many descendants  </s>
<s> and so after waiting patiently  abraham received what was promised </s>
<s> people swear by someone greater than themselves  and the oath confirms what is said and puts an end to all argument </s>
<s> because god wanted to make the unchanging nature of his purpose very clear to the heirs of what was promised  he confirmed it with an oath </s>
<s> god did this so that  by two unchangeable things in which it is impossible for god to lie  we who have fled to take hold of the hope set before us may be greatly encouraged </s>
<s> we have this hope as an anchor for the soul  firm and secure  it enters the inner sanctuary behind the curtain </s>
<s> where our forerunner  jesus  has entered on our behalf  he has become a high priest for ever  in the order of melchizedek </s>
<s> this melchizedek was king of salem and priest of god most high  he met abraham returning from the defeat of the kings and blessed him </s>
<s> and abraham gave him a tenth of everything  first  the name melchizedek means  king of righteousness  then also   king of salem means  king of peace </s>
<s> without father or mother  without genealogy  without beginning of days or end of life  resembling the son of god  he remains a priest for ever </s>
<s> just think how great he was  even the patriarch abraham gave him a tenth of the plunder </s>
<s> now the law requires the descendants of levi who become priests to collect a tenth from the people  that is  from their fellow israelites  even though they also are descended from abraham </s>
<s> this man  however  did not trace his descent from levi  yet he collected a tenth from abraham and blessed him who had the promises </s>
<s> and without doubt the lesser is blessed by the greater </s>
<s> in the one case  the tenth is collected by people who die  but in the other case  by him who is declared to be living </s>
<s> one might even say that levi  who collects the tenth  paid the tenth through abraham </s>
<s> because when melchizedek met abraham  levi was still in the body of his ancestor </s>
<s> if perfection could have been attained through the levitical priesthood  and indeed the law given to the people established that priesthood  why was there still need for another priest to come  one in the order of melchizedek  not in the order of aaron </s>
<s> for when the priesthood is changed  the law must be changed also </s>
<s> he of whom these things are said belonged to a different tribe  and no one from that tribe has ever served at the altar </s>
<s> for it is clear that our lord descended from judah  and in regard to that tribe moses said nothing about priests </s>
<s> and what we have said is even more clear if another priest like melchizedek appears </s>
<s> one who has become a priest not on the basis of a regulation as to his ancestry but on the basis of the power of an indestructible life </s>
<s> for it is declared   you are a priest for ever  in the order of melchizedek  </s>
<s> the former regulation is set aside because it was weak and useless</s>
<s>  for the law made nothing perfect   and a better hope is introduced  by which we draw near to god </s>
<s> and it was not without an oath  others became priests without any oath </s>
<s> but he became a priest with an oath when god said to him   the lord has sworn and will not change his mind   you are a priest for ever   </s>
<s> now there have been many of those priests  since death prevented them from continuing in office </s>
<s> but because jesus lives for ever  he has a permanent priesthood </s>
<s> therefore he is able to save completely those who come to god through him  because he always lives to intercede for them </s>
<s> such a high priest truly meets our need  one who is holy  blameless  pure  set apart from sinners  exalted above the heavens </s>
<s> unlike the other high priests  he does not need to offer sacrifices day after day  first for his own sins  and then for the sins of the people  he sacrificed for their sins once for all when he offered himself </s>
<s> for the law appoints as high priests men in all their weakness  but the oath  which came after the law  appointed the son  who has been made perfect for ever </s>
<s> now the main point of what we are saying is this  we do have such a high priest  who sat down at the right hand of the throne of the majesty in heaven </s>
<s> and who serves in the sanctuary  the true tabernacle set up by the lord  not by a mere human being </s>
<s> every high priest is appointed to offer both gifts and sacrifices  and so it was necessary for this one also to have something to offer </s>
<s> if he were on earth  he would not be a priest  for there are already priests who offer the gifts prescribed by the law </s>
<s> they serve at a sanctuary that is a copy and shadow of what is in heaven  this is why moses was warned when he was about to build the tabernacle   see to it that you make everything according to the pattern shown you on the mountain  </s>
<s> but in fact the ministry jesus has received is as superior to theirs as the covenant of which he is mediator is superior to the old one  since the new covenant is established on better promises </s>
<s> for if there had been nothing wrong with that first covenant  no place would have been sought for another </s>
<s> but god found fault with the people and said   the days are coming  declares the lord  when i will make a new covenant with the people of israel and with the people of judah </s>
<s> it will not be like the covenant i made with their ancestors when i took them by the hand to lead them out of egypt  because they did not remain faithful to my covenant  and i turned away from them </s>
<s> this is the covenant i will establish with the people of israel after that time  declares the lord  i will put my laws in their minds and write them on their hearts  i will be their god  and they will be my people </s>
<s> no longer will they teach their neighbours  or say to one another   know the lord   because they will all know me  from the least of them to the greatest </s>
<s> for i will forgive their wickedness and will remember their sins no more  </s>
<s> by calling this covenant  new  he has made the first one obsolete  and what is obsolete and outdated will soon disappear </s>
<s> now the first covenant had regulations for worship and also an earthly sanctuary </s>
<s> a tabernacle was set up  in its first room were the lampstand and the table with its consecrated bread  this was called the holy place </s>
<s> behind the second curtain was a room called the most holy place </s>
<s> which had the golden altar of incense and the goldcovered ark of the covenant  this ark contained the gold jar of manna  aarons staff that had budded  and the stone tablets of the covenant </s>
<s> above the ark were the cherubim of the glory  overshadowing the atonement cover  but we cannot discuss these things in detail now </s>
<s> when everything had been arranged like this  the priests entered regularly into the outer room to carry on their ministry </s>
<s> but only the high priest entered the inner room  and that only once a year  and never without blood  which he offered for himself and for the sins the people had committed in ignorance </s>
<s> the holy spirit was showing by this that the way into the most holy place had not yet been disclosed as long as the first tabernacle was still functioning </s>
<s> this is an illustration for the present time  indicating that the gifts and sacrifices being offered were not able to clear the conscience of the worshipper </s>
<s> they are only a matter of food and drink and various ceremonial washings  external regulations applying until the time of the new order </s>
<s> but when christ came as high priest of the good things that are now already here  he went through the greater and more perfect tabernacle that is not made with human hands  that is to say  is not a part of this creation </s>
<s> he did not enter by means of the blood of goats and calves  but he entered the most holy place once for all by his own blood  so obtaining eternal redemption </s>
<s> the blood of goats and bulls and the ashes of a heifer sprinkled on those who are ceremonially unclean sanctify them so that they are outwardly clean </s>
<s> how much more  then  will the blood of christ  who through the eternal spirit offered himself unblemished to god  cleanse our consciences from acts that lead to death  so that we may serve the living god </s>
<s> for this reason christ is the mediator of a new covenant  that those who are called may receive the promised eternal inheritance  now that he has died as a ransom to set them free from the sins committed under the first covenant </s>
<s> in the case of a will  it is necessary to prove the death of the one who made it </s>
<s> because a will is in force only when somebody has died  it never takes effect while the one who made it is living </s>
<s> this is why even the first covenant was not put into effect without blood </s>
<s> when moses had proclaimed every command of the law to all the people  he took the blood of calves  together with water  scarlet wool and branches of hyssop  and sprinkled the scroll and all the people </s>
<s> he said   this is the blood of the covenant  which god has commanded you to keep  </s>
<s> in the same way  he sprinkled with the blood both the tabernacle and everything used in its ceremonies </s>
<s> in fact  the law requires that nearly everything be cleansed with blood  and without the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness </s>
<s> it was necessary  then  for the copies of the heavenly things to be purified with these sacrifices  but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these </s>
<s> for christ did not enter a sanctuary made with human hands that was only a copy of the true one  he entered heaven itself  now to appear for us in gods presence </s>
<s> nor did he enter heaven to offer himself again and again  the way the high priest enters the most holy place every year with blood that is not his own </s>
<s> otherwise christ would have had to suffer many times since the creation of the world  but he has appeared once for all at the culmination of the ages to do away with sin by the sacrifice of himself </s>
<s> just as people are destined to die once  and after that to face judgment </s>
<s> so christ was sacrificed once to take away the sins of many  and he will appear a second time  not to bear sin  but to bring salvation to those who are waiting for him </s>
<s> the law is only a shadow of the good things that are coming  not the realities themselves  for this reason it can never  by the same sacrifices repeated endlessly year after year  make perfect those who draw near to worship </s>
<s> otherwise  would they not have stopped being offered  for the worshippers would have been cleansed once for all  and would no longer have felt guilty for their sins </s>
<s> but those sacrifices are an annual reminder of sins </s>
<s> it is impossible for the blood of bulls and goats to take away sins </s>
<s> therefore  when christ came into the world  he said   sacrifice and offering you did not desire  but a body you prepared for me </s>
<s> with burnt offerings and sin offerings you were not pleased </s>
<s> then i said   here i am  it is written about me in the scroll  i have come to do your will  my god   </s>
<s> day after day every priest stands and performs his religious duties  again and again he offers the same sacrifices  which can never take away sins </s>
<s> but when this priest had offered for all time one sacrifice for sins  he sat down at the right hand of god </s>
<s> and since that time he waits for his enemies to be made his footstool </s>
<s> for by one sacrifice he has made perfect for ever those who are being made holy </s>
<s> the holy spirit also testifies to us about this  first he says </s>
<s>  this is the covenant i will make with them after that time  says the lord  i will put my laws in their hearts  and i will write them on their minds    their sins and lawless acts i will remember no more  </s>
<s> and where these have been forgiven  sacrifice for sin is no longer necessary </s>
<s> therefore  brothers and sisters  since we have confidence to enter the most holy place by the blood of jesus </s>
<s> by a new and living way opened for us through the curtain  that is  his body </s>
<s> and since we have a great priest over the house of god </s>
<s> let us draw near to god with a sincere heart and with the full assurance that faith brings  having our hearts sprinkled to cleanse us from a guilty conscience and having our bodies washed with pure water </s>
<s> let us hold unswervingly to the hope we profess  for he who promised is faithful </s>
<s> and let us consider how we may spur one another on towards love and good deeds </s>
<s> not giving up meeting together  as some are in the habit of doing  but encouraging one another  and all the more as you see the day approaching </s>
<s> if we deliberately keep on sinning after we have received the knowledge of the truth  no sacrifice for sins is left </s>
<s> but only a fearful expectation of judgment and of raging fire that will consume the enemies of god </s>
<s> anyone who rejected the law of moses died without mercy on the testimony of two or three witnesses </s>
<s> how much more severely do you think someone deserves to be punished who has trampled the son of god underfoot  who has treated as an unholy thing the blood of the covenant that sanctified them  and who has insulted the spirit of grace </s>
<s> for we know him who said   it is mine to avenge  i will repay   and again   the lord will judge his people  </s>
<s> it is a dreadful thing to fall into the hands of the living god </s>
<s> remember those earlier days after you had received the light  when you endured in a great conflict full of suffering </s>
<s> sometimes you were publicly exposed to insult and persecution  at other times you stood side by side with those who were so treated </s>
<s> you suffered along with those in prison and joyfully accepted the confiscation of your property  because you knew that you yourselves had better and lasting possessions </s>
<s> so do not throw away your confidence  it will be richly rewarded </s>
<s> you need to persevere so that when you have done the will of god  you will receive what he has promised </s>
<s> for   in just a little while  he who is coming will come and will not delay    but my righteous one will live by faith  and i take no pleasure in the one who shrinks back  </s>
<s> now faith is confidence in what we hope for and assurance about what we do not see </s>
<s> this is what the ancients were commended for </s>
<s> by faith we understand that the universe was formed at gods command  so that what is seen was not made out of what was visible </s>
<s> by faith abel brought god a better offering than cain did  by faith he was commended as righteous  when god spoke well of his offerings  and by faith abel still speaks  even though he is dead </s>
<s> by faith enoch was taken from this life  so that he did not experience death   he could not be found  because god had taken him away   for before he was taken  he was commended as one who pleased god </s>
<s> and without faith it is impossible to please god  because anyone who comes to him must believe that he exists and that he rewards those who earnestly seek him </s>
<s> by faith noah  when warned about things not yet seen  in holy fear built an ark to save his family  by his faith he condemned the world and became heir of the righteousness that is in keeping with faith </s>
<s> by faith abraham  when called to go to a place he would later receive as his inheritance  obeyed and went  even though he did not know where he was going </s>
<s> by faith he made his home in the promised land like a stranger in a foreign country  he lived in tents  as did isaac and jacob  who were heirs with him of the same promise </s>
<s> for he was looking forward to the city with foundations  whose architect and builder is god </s>
<s> and by faith even sarah  who was past childbearing age  was enabled to bear children because she considered him faithful who had made the promise </s>
<s> and so from this one man  and he as good as dead  came descendants as numerous as the stars in the sky and as countless as the sand on the seashore </s>
<s> all these people were still living by faith when they died  they did not receive the things promised  they only saw them and welcomed them from a distance  admitting that they were foreigners and strangers on earth </s>
<s> people who say such things show that they are looking for a country of their own </s>
<s> if they had been thinking of the country they had left  they would have had opportunity to return </s>
<s> instead  they were longing for a better country  a heavenly one  therefore god is not ashamed to be called their god  for he has prepared a city for them </s>
<s> by faith abraham  when god tested him  offered isaac as a sacrifice  he who had embraced the promises was about to sacrifice his one and only son </s>
<s> even though god had said to him   it is through isaac that your offspring will be reckoned  </s>
<s> abraham reasoned that god could even raise the dead  and so in a manner of speaking he did receive isaac back from death </s>
<s> by faith isaac blessed jacob and esau in regard to their future </s>
<s> by faith jacob  when he was dying  blessed each of josephs sons  and worshipped as he leaned on the top of his staff </s>
<s> by faith joseph  when his end was near  spoke about the exodus of the israelites from egypt and gave instructions concerning the burial of his bones </s>
<s> by faith moses parents hid him for three months after he was born  because they saw he was no ordinary child  and they were not afraid of the kings edict </s>
<s> by faith moses  when he had grown up  refused to be known as the son of pharaohs daughter </s>
<s> he chose to be illtreated along with the people of god rather than to enjoy the fleeting pleasures of sin </s>
<s> he regarded disgrace for the sake of christ as of greater value than the treasures of egypt  because he was looking ahead to his reward </s>
<s> by faith he left egypt  not fearing the kings anger  he persevered because he saw him who is invisible </s>
<s> by faith he kept the passover and the application of blood  so that the destroyer of the firstborn would not touch the firstborn of israel </s>
<s> by faith the people passed through the red sea as on dry land  but when the egyptians tried to do so  they were drowned </s>
<s> by faith the walls of jericho fell  after the army had marched round them for seven days </s>
<s> by faith the prostitute rahab  because she welcomed the spies  was not killed with those who were disobedient </s>
<s> and what more shall i say  i do not have time to tell about gideon  barak  samson and jephthah  about david and samuel and the prophets </s>
<s> who through faith conquered kingdoms  administered justice  and gained what was promised  who shut the mouths of lions </s>
<s> quenched the fury of the flames  and escaped the edge of the sword  whose weakness was turned to strength  and who became powerful in battle and routed foreign armies </s>
<s> women received back their dead  raised to life again  there were others who were tortured  refusing to be released so that they might gain an even better resurrection </s>
<s> some faced jeers and flogging  and even chains and imprisonment </s>
<s> they were put to death by stoning  they were sawn in two  they were killed by the sword  they went about in sheepskins and goatskins  destitute  persecuted and illtreated </s>
<s> the world was not worthy of them  they wandered in deserts and mountains  living in caves and in holes in the ground </s>
<s> these were all commended for their faith  yet none of them received what had been promised </s>
<s> since god had planned something better for us so that only together with us would they be made perfect </s>
<s> therefore  since we are surrounded by such a great cloud of witnesses  let us throw off everything that hinders and the sin that so easily entangles  and let us run with perseverance the race marked out for us </s>
<s> fixing our eyes on jesus  the pioneer and perfecter of faith  for the joy that was set before him he endured the cross  scorning its shame  and sat down at the right hand of the throne of god </s>
<s> consider him who endured such opposition from sinners  so that you will not grow weary and lose heart </s>
<s> in your struggle against sin  you have not yet resisted to the point of shedding your blood </s>
<s> and have you completely forgotten this word of encouragement that addresses you as a father addresses his son  it says   my son  do not make light of the lords discipline  and do not lose heart when he rebukes you </s>
<s> because the lord disciplines the one he loves  and he chastens everyone he accepts as his son  </s>
<s> endure hardship as discipline  god is treating you as his children  for what children are not disciplined by their father </s>
<s> if you are not disciplined  and everyone undergoes discipline  then you are not legitimate  not true sons and daughters at all </s>
<s> moreover  we have all had human fathers who disciplined us and we respected them for it  how much more should we submit to the father of spirits and live </s>
<s> they disciplined us for a little while as they thought best  but god disciplines us for our good  in order that we may share in his holiness </s>
<s> no discipline seems pleasant at the time  but painful  later on  however  it produces a harvest of righteousness and peace for those who have been trained by it </s>
<s> therefore  strengthen your feeble arms and weak knees </s>
<s>  make level paths for your feet   so that the lame may not be disabled  but rather healed </s>
<s> make every effort to live in peace with everyone and to be holy  without holiness no one will see the lord </s>
<s> see to it that no one falls short of the grace of god and that no bitter root grows up to cause trouble and defile many </s>
<s> see that no one is sexually immoral  or is godless like esau  who for a single meal sold his inheritance rights as the oldest son </s>
<s> afterwards  as you know  when he wanted to inherit this blessing  he was rejected  even though he sought the blessing with tears  he could not change what he had done </s>
<s> you have not come to a mountain that can be touched and that is burning with fire  to darkness  gloom and storm </s>
<s> to a trumpet blast or to such a voice speaking words that those who heard it begged that no further word be spoken to them </s>
<s> because they could not bear what was commanded   if even an animal touches the mountain  it must be stoned to death  </s>
<s> the sight was so terrifying that moses said   i am trembling with fear  </s>
<s> but you have come to mount zion  to the city of the living god  the heavenly jerusalem  you have come to thousands upon thousands of angels in joyful assembly </s>
<s> to the church of the firstborn  whose names are written in heaven  you have come to god  the judge of all  to the spirits of the righteous made perfect </s>
<s> to jesus the mediator of a new covenant  and to the sprinkled blood that speaks a better word than the blood of abel </s>
<s> see to it that you do not refuse him who speaks  if they did not escape when they refused him who warned them on earth  how much less will we  if we turn away from him who warns us from heaven </s>
<s> at that time his voice shook the earth  but now he has promised   once more i will shake not only the earth but also the heavens  </s>
<s> the words  once more indicate the removing of what can be shaken  that is  created things  so that what cannot be shaken may remain </s>
<s> therefore  since we are receiving a kingdom that cannot be shaken  let us be thankful  and so worship god acceptably with reverence and awe </s>
<s> for our  god is a consuming fire  </s>
<s> keep on loving one another as brothers and sisters </s>
<s> do not forget to show hospitality to strangers  for by so doing some people have shown hospitality to angels without knowing it </s>
<s> continue to remember those in prison as if you were together with them in prison  and those who are illtreated as if you yourselves were suffering </s>
<s> marriage should be honoured by all  and the marriage bed kept pure  for god will judge the adulterer and all the sexually immoral </s>
<s> keep your lives free from the love of money and be content with what you have  because god has said   never will i leave you  never will i forsake you    the lord is my helper  i will not be afraid  what can mere mortals do to me  </s>
<s> remember your leaders  who spoke the word of god to you  consider the outcome of their way of life and imitate their faith </s>
<s> jesus christ is the same yesterday and today and for ever </s>
<s> do not be carried away by all kinds of strange teachings  it is good for our hearts to be strengthened by grace  not by eating ceremonial foods  which is of no benefit to those who do so </s>
<s> we have an altar from which those who minister at the tabernacle have no right to eat </s>
<s> the high priest carries the blood of animals into the most holy place as a sin offering  but the bodies are burned outside the camp </s>
<s> and so jesus also suffered outside the city gate to make the people holy through his own blood </s>
<s> let us  then  go to him outside the camp  bearing the disgrace he bore </s>
<s> for here we do not have an enduring city  but we are looking for the city that is to come </s>
<s> through jesus  therefore  let us continually offer to god a sacrifice of praise  the fruit of lips that openly profess his name </s>
<s> and do not forget to do good and to share with others  for with such sacrifices god is pleased </s>
<s> have confidence in your leaders and submit to their authority  because they keep watch over you as those who must give an account  do this so that their work will be a joy  not a burden  for that would be of no benefit to you </s>
<s> pray for us  we are sure that we have a clear conscience and desire to live honourably in every way </s>
<s> i particularly urge you to pray so that i may be restored to you soon </s>
<s> now may the god of peace  who through the blood of the eternal covenant brought back from the dead our lord jesus  that great shepherd of the sheep </s>
<s> equip you with everything good for doing his will  and may he work in us what is pleasing to him  through jesus christ  to whom be glory for ever and ever  amen </s>
<s> brothers and sisters  i urge you to bear with my word of exhortation  for in fact i have written to you quite briefly </s>
<s> i want you to know that our brother timothy has been released  if he arrives soon  i will come with him to see you </s>

<s> consider it pure joy  my brothers and sisters  whenever you face trials of many kinds </s>
<s> because you know that the testing of your faith produces perseverance </s>
<s> let perseverance finish its work so that you may be mature and complete  not lacking anything </s>
<s> if any of you lacks wisdom  you should ask god  who gives generously to all without finding fault  and it will be given to you </s>
<s> but when you ask  you must believe and not doubt  because the one who doubts is like a wave of the sea  blown and tossed by the wind </s>
<s> that person should not expect to receive anything from the lord </s>
<s> such a person is doubleminded and unstable in all they do </s>
<s> believers in humble circumstances ought to take pride in their high position </s>
<s> but the rich should take pride in their humiliation  since they will pass away like a wild flower </s>
<s> for the sun rises with scorching heat and withers the plant  its blossom falls and its beauty is destroyed  in the same way  the rich will fade away even while they go about their business </s>
<s> blessed is the one who perseveres under trial because  having stood the test  that person will receive the crown of life that the lord has promised to those who love him </s>
<s> when tempted  no one should say   god is tempting me   for god cannot be tempted by evil  nor does he tempt anyone </s>
<s> but each person is tempted when they are dragged away by their own evil desire and enticed </s>
<s> then  after desire has conceived  it gives birth to sin  and sin  when it is fullgrown  gives birth to death </s>
<s> dont be deceived  my dear brothers and sisters </s>
<s> every good and perfect gift is from above  coming down from the father of the heavenly lights  who does not change like shifting shadows </s>
<s> he chose to give us birth through the word of truth  that we might be a kind of firstfruits of all he created </s>
<s> my dear brothers and sisters  take note of this  everyone should be quick to listen  slow to speak and slow to become angry </s>
<s> because human anger does not produce the righteousness that god desires </s>
<s> therefore  get rid of all moral filth and the evil that is so prevalent  and humbly accept the word planted in you  which can save you </s>
<s> do not merely listen to the word  and so deceive yourselves  do what it says </s>
<s> anyone who listens to the word but does not do what it says is like someone who looks at his face in a mirror</s>

<s> listen  my dear brothers and sisters  has not god chosen those who are poor in the eyes of the world to be rich in faith and to inherit the kingdom he promised those who love him </s>

<s> live such good lives among the pagans that  though they accuse you of doing wrong  they may see your good deeds and glorify god on the day he visits us </s>
<s> submit yourselves for the lords sake to every human authority  whether to the emperor  as the supreme authority </s>
<s> or to governors  who are sent by him to punish those who do wrong and to commend those who do right </s>
<s> for it is gods will that by doing good you should silence the ignorant talk of foolish people </s>
<s> live as free people  but do not use your freedom as a coverup for evil  live as gods slaves </s>
<s> show proper respect to everyone  love the family of believers  fear god  honour the emperor </s>
<s> slaves  in reverent fear of god submit yourselves to your masters  not only to those who are good and considerate  but also to those who are harsh </s>
<s> for it is commendable if someone bears up under the pain of unjust suffering because they are conscious of god </s>
<s> but how is it to your credit if you receive a beating for doing wrong and endure it  but if you suffer for doing good and you endure it  this is commendable before god </s>
<s> to this you were called  because christ suffered for you  leaving you an example  that you should follow in his steps </s>
<s>  he committed no sin  and no deceit was found in his mouth  </s>
<s> wives  in the same way submit yourselves to your own husbands so that  if any of them do not believe the word  they may be won over without words by the behaviour of their wives </s>
<s> when they see the purity and reverence of your lives </s>
<s> your beauty should not come from outward adornment  such as elaborate hairstyles and the wearing of gold jewellery or fine clothes </s>
<s> rather  it should be that of your inner self  the unfading beauty of a gentle and quiet spirit  which is of great worth in gods sight </s>
<s> for this is the way the holy women of the past who put their hope in god used to adorn themselves  they submitted themselves to their own husbands </s>
<s> like sarah  who obeyed abraham and called him her lord  you are her daughters if you do what is right and do not give way to fear </s>
<s> husbands  in the same way be considerate as you live with your wives  and treat them with respect as the weaker partner and as heirs with you of the gracious gift of life  so that nothing will hinder your prayers </s>
<s> finally  all of you  be likeminded  be sympathetic  love one another  be compassionate and humble </s>
<s> do not repay evil with evil or insult with insult  on the contrary  repay evil with blessing  because to this you were called so that you may inherit a blessing </s>
<s> for   whoever would love life and see good days must keep their tongue from evil and their lips from deceitful speech </s>
<s> they must turn from evil and do good  they must seek peace and pursue it </s>
<s> for the eyes of the lord are on the righteous and his ears are attentive to their prayer  but the face of the lord is against those who do evil  </s>
<s> who is going to harm you if you are eager to do good </s>
<s> but even if you should suffer for what is right  you are blessed   do not fear their threats  do not be frightened  </s>
<s> but in your hearts revere christ as lord  always be prepared to give an answer to everyone who asks you to give the reason for the hope that you have  but do this with gentleness and respect </s>
<s> keeping a clear conscience  so that those who speak maliciously against your good behaviour in christ may be ashamed of their slander </s>
<s> for it is better  if it is gods will  to suffer for doing good than for doing evil </s>
<s> for christ also suffered once for sins  the righteous for the unrighteous  to bring you to god  he was put to death in the body but made alive in the spirit </s>
<s> after being made alive  he went and made proclamation to the imprisoned spirits </s>
<s> to those who were disobedient long ago when god waited patiently in the days of noah while the ark was being built  in it only a few people  eight in all  were saved through water </s>
<s> and this water symbolises baptism that now saves you also  not the removal of dirt from the body but the pledge of a clear conscience towards god  it saves you by the resurrection of jesus christ </s>
<s> who has gone into heaven and is at gods right hand  with angels  authorities and powers in submission to him </s>
<s> therefore  since christ suffered in his body  arm yourselves also with the same attitude  because whoever suffers in the body has finished with sin </s>
<s> as a result  they do not live the rest of their earthly lives for evil human desires  but rather for the will of god </s>
<s> for you have spent enough time in the past doing what pagans choose to do  living in debauchery  lust  drunkenness  orgies  carousing and detestable idolatry </s>
<s> they are surprised that you do not join them in their reckless  wild living  and they heap abuse on you </s>
<s> but they will have to give account to him who is ready to judge the living and the dead </s>
<s> for this is the reason the gospel was preached even to those who are now dead  so that they might be judged according to human standards in regard to the body  but live according to god in regard to the spirit </s>
<s> the end of all things is near  therefore be alert and of sober mind so that you may pray </s>
<s> above all  love each other deeply  because love covers over a multitude of sins </s>
<s> offer hospitality to one another without grumbling </s>
<s> each of you should use whatever gift you have received to serve others  as faithful stewards of gods grace in its various forms </s>
<s> if anyone speaks  they should do so as one who speaks the very words of god  if anyone serves  they should do so with the strength god provides  so that in all things god may be praised through jesus christ  to him be the glory and the power for ever and ever  amen </s>
<s> dear friends  do not be surprised at the fiery ordeal that has come on you to test you  as though something strange were happening to you </s>
<s> but rejoice inasmuch as you participate in the sufferings of christ  so that you may be overjoyed when his glory is revealed </s>
<s> if you are insulted because of the name of christ  you are blessed  for the spirit of glory and of god rests on you </s>
<s> if you suffer  it should not be as a murderer or thief or any other kind of criminal  or even as a meddler </s>
<s> however  if you suffer as a christian  do not be ashamed  but praise god that you bear that name </s>
<s> for it is time for judgment to begin with gods household  and if it begins with us  what will the outcome be for those who do not obey the gospel of god </s>
<s> and   if it is hard for the righteous to be saved  what will become of the ungodly and the sinner  </s>
<s> so then  those who suffer according to gods will should commit themselves to their faithful creator and continue to do good </s>
<s> to the elders among you  i appeal as a fellow elder and a witness of christs sufferings who also will share in the glory to be revealed </s>
<s> be shepherds of gods flock that is under your care  watching over them  not because you must  but because you are willing  as god wants you to be  not pursuing dishonest gain  but eager to serve </s>
<s> not lording it over those entrusted to you  but being examples to the flock </s>
<s> and when the chief shepherd appears  you will receive the crown of glory that will never fade away </s>
<s> in the same way  you who are younger  submit yourselves to your elders  all of you  clothe yourselves with humility towards one another  because   god opposes the proud but shows favour to the humble  </s>
<s> be alert and of sober mind  your enemy the devil prowls around like a roaring lion looking for someone to devour </s>

<s> because i know that i will soon put it aside  as our lord jesus christ has made clear to me </s>
<s> and i will make every effort to see that after my departure you will always be able to remember these things </s>

<s> he received honour and glory from god the father when the voice came to him from the majestic glory  saying   this is my son  whom i love  with him i am well pleased  </s>
<s> we ourselves heard this voice that came from heaven when we were with him on the sacred mountain </s>
<s> we also have the prophetic message as something completely reliable  and you will do well to pay attention to it  as to a light shining in a dark place  until the day dawns and the morning star rises in your hearts </s>
<s> above all  you must understand that no prophecy of scripture came about by the prophets own interpretation of things </s>
<s> for prophecy never had its origin in the human will  but prophets  though human  spoke from god as they were carried along by the holy spirit </s>
<s> but there were also false prophets among the people  just as there will be false teachers among you  they will secretly introduce destructive heresies  even denying the sovereign lord who bought them  bringing swift destruction on themselves </s>
<s> many will follow their depraved conduct and will bring the way of truth into disrepute </s>
<s> in their greed these teachers will exploit you with fabricated stories  their condemnation has long been hanging over them  and their destruction has not been sleeping </s>
<s> for if god did not spare angels when they sinned  but sent them to hell  putting them in chains of darkness to be held for judgment </s>
<s> if he did not spare the ancient world when he brought the flood on its ungodly people  but protected noah  a preacher of righteousness  and seven others </s>
<s> if he condemned the cities of sodom and gomorrah by burning them to ashes  and made them an example of what is going to happen to the ungodly </s>
<s> and if he rescued lot  a righteous man  who was distressed by the depraved conduct of the lawless</s>
<s>  for that righteous man  living among them day after day  was tormented in his righteous soul by the lawless deeds he saw and heard  </s>
<s> if this is so  then the lord knows how to rescue the godly from trials and to hold the unrighteous for punishment on the day of judgment </s>
<s> this is especially true of those who follow the corrupt desire of the flesh and despise authority  bold and arrogant  they are not afraid to heap abuse on celestial beings </s>
<s> yet even angels  although they are stronger and more powerful  do not heap abuse on such beings when bringing judgment on them from the lord </s>
<s> but these people blaspheme in matters they do not understand  they are like unreasoning animals  creatures of instinct  born only to be caught and destroyed  and like animals they too will perish </s>
<s> they will be paid back with harm for the harm they have done  their idea of pleasure is to carouse in broad daylight  they are blots and blemishes  revelling in their pleasures while they feast with you </s>
<s> with eyes full of adultery  they never stop sinning  they seduce the unstable  they are experts in greed  an accursed brood </s>
<s> they have left the straight way and wandered off to follow the way of balaam son of bezer  who loved the wages of wickedness </s>
<s> but he was rebuked for his wrongdoing by a donkey  an animal without speech  who spoke with a human voice and restrained the prophets madness </s>
<s> these people are springs without water and mists driven by a storm  blackest darkness is reserved for them </s>
<s> for they mouth empty  boastful words and  by appealing to the lustful desires of the flesh  they entice people who are just escaping from those who live in error </s>
<s> they promise them freedom  while they themselves are slaves of depravity  for  people are slaves to whatever has mastered them  </s>
<s> if they have escaped the corruption of the world by knowing our lord and saviour jesus christ and are again entangled in it and are overcome  they are worse off at the end than they were at the beginning </s>
<s> it would have been better for them not to have known the way of righteousness  than to have known it and then to turn their backs on the sacred command that was passed on to them </s>
<s> of them the proverbs are true   a dog returns to its vomit   and   a sow that is washed returns to her wallowing in the mud  </s>
<s> dear friends  this is now my second letter to you  i have written both of them as reminders to stimulate you to wholesome thinking </s>
<s> i want you to recall the words spoken in the past by the holy prophets and the command given by our lord and saviour through your apostles </s>
<s> above all  you must understand that in the last days scoffers will come  scoffing and following their own evil desires </s>
<s> they will say   where is this   coming he promised  ever since our ancestors died  everything goes on as it has since the beginning of creation  </s>
<s> but they deliberately forget that long ago by gods word the heavens came into being and the earth was formed out of water and by water </s>
<s> by these waters also the world of that time was deluged and destroyed </s>
<s> by the same word the present heavens and earth are reserved for fire  being kept for the day of judgment and destruction of the ungodly </s>
<s> but do not forget this one thing  dear friends  with the lord a day is like a thousand years  and a thousand years are like a day </s>
<s> the lord is not slow in keeping his promise  as some understand slowness  instead he is patient with you  not wanting anyone to perish  but everyone to come to repentance </s>
<s> but the day of the lord will come like a thief  the heavens will disappear with a roar  the elements will be destroyed by fire  and the earth and everything done in it will be laid bare </s>
<s> since everything will be destroyed in this way  what kind of people ought you to be  you ought to live holy and godly lives</s>
<s> as you look forward to the day of god and speed its coming  that day will bring about the destruction of the heavens by fire  and the elements will melt in the heat </s>
<s> but in keeping with his promise we are looking forward to a new heaven and a new earth  where righteousness dwells </s>
<s> so then  dear friends  since you are looking forward to this  make every effort to be found spotless  blameless and at peace with him </s>
<s> bear in mind that our lords patience means salvation  just as our dear brother paul also wrote to you with the wisdom that god gave him </s>
<s> he writes the same way in all his letters  speaking in them of these matters  his letters contain some things that are hard to understand  which ignorant and unstable people distort  as they do the other scriptures  to their own destruction </s>
<s> therefore  dear friends  since you have been forewarned  be on your guard so that you may not be carried away by the error of the lawless and fall from your secure position </s>

<s> if we claim to be without sin  we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us </s>
<s> if we confess our sins  he is faithful and just and will forgive us our sins and purify us from all unrighteousness </s>
<s> if we claim we have not sinned  we make him out to be a liar and his word is not in us </s>
<s> my dear children  i write this to you so that you will not sin  but if anybody does sin  we have an advocate with the father  jesus christ  the righteous one </s>

<s> dear friends  let us love one another  for love comes from god  everyone who loves has been born of god and knows god </s>
<s> whoever does not love does not know god  because god is love </s>
<s> this is how god showed his love among us  he sent his one and only son into the world that we might live through him </s>

<s> if anyone acknowledges that jesus is the son of god  god lives in them and they in god </s>

<s> this is how love is made complete among us so that we will have confidence on the day of judgment  in this world we are like jesus </s>
<s> there is no fear in love  but perfect love drives out fear  because fear has to do with punishment  the one who fears is not made perfect in love </s>
<s> we love because he first loved us </s>
<s> whoever claims to love god yet hates a brother or sister is a liar  for whoever does not love their brother and sister  whom they have seen  cannot love god  whom they have not seen </s>

<s> for everyone born of god overcomes the world  this is the victory that has overcome the world  even our faith </s>
<s> who is it that overcomes the world  only the one who believes that jesus is the son of god </s>

<s> for there are three that testify </s>
<s> the spirit  the water and the blood  and the three are in agreement </s>
<s> we accept human testimony  but gods testimony is greater because it is the testimony of god  which he has given about his son </s>

<s> and this is the testimony  god has given us eternal life  and this life is in his son </s>
<s> whoever has the son has life  whoever does not have the son of god does not have life </s>
